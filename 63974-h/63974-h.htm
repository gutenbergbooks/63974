  <h2 class='c005'>INTRODUCTION.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>For many years I have ardently wished that
it had been possible for me to plead, in your
presence, the great cause of the Abolition of
the Slave Trade. Conscious that I was accountable
to you for the discharge of the
important trust which your kindness had
committed to me, I have longed for such an
opportunity of convincing you, that it was
not without reason that this question had
occupied so large a share of my parliamentary
life. I wished you to know, that the cause
of my complaint was no minute grievance,
which, from my eyes having been continually
fixed on it, had swelled by degrees into a
false shew of magnitude; no ordinary question,
on which my mind, warming in the pursuit
of its object, and animated by repeated
contentions, had at length felt emotions
altogether disproportionate to their subject.
Had I however erred, unintentionally, I have
too long experienced your candour not to have
hoped for your ready forgiveness. On the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2'>2</span>contrary, if the Slave Trade be indeed the
foulest blot that ever stained our National
character, you will not deem your Representative
to have been unworthily employed, in
having been among the foremost in wiping
it away.</p>

<p class='c010'>Besides the desire of justifying myself in
the judgment of my Constituents, various
other motives prompt me to the present address.
Fourteen long years have now elapsed
since the period when the question was fully
argued in Parliament; and the large share of
national attention which it then engaged, has
since been occupied successively by the various
public topics of the day. During the
intervening period, also, such strange and interesting
spectacles have been exhibited at
our very doors, as to banish from the minds
of most men all recollection of distant wrongs
and sufferings. Thus it is not only by the
ordinary effects of the lapse of time, that the
impression, first produced by laying open the
horrors of the Slave Trade, has been considerably
effaced, but by the prodigious events
of that fearful interval.</p>

<p class='c010'>It should also be remembered, that, within
the last fourteen or fifteen years, a great
change has taken place in the component
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3'>3</span>parts of Parliament, especially in those of the
House of Commons; not merely from the
ordinary causes, but also from the addition
which has been made to the National Legislature
by our Union with Ireland. Hence it
happens, that, even in the Houses of Parliament
themselves, though a distinct impression
of the general outlines of the subject
may remain, many of its particular features
have faded from the recollection. For hence
alone surely it can happen, that assertions
and arguments formerly driven fairly out of
the field, appear once more in array against
us. Old concessions are retracted; exploded
errors are revived; and we find we have the
greater part of our work to do over again.
But if in Parliament, nay even in the House
of Commons itself, where the subject was once
so well known in all its parts, the question
is but imperfectly understood, much more is
it natural, that great misconceptions should
prevail respecting it in the minds of the people
at large. Among them, accordingly, great
misapprehensions are very general. To myself,
as well as to other Abolitionists, opinions are
often imputed which we never held, declarations
which we never made, designs which we
never entertained. These I desire to rectify;
and now that the question is once more about
to come under the consideration of the legislature,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>it may not be useless thus publicly to
record the facts and principles on which the
Abolitionists rest their cause, and for which,
in the face of my country, I am willing to
stand responsible.</p>

<p class='c010'>But farther I hesitate not to avow to you;
on the contrary, it would be criminal to withhold
the declaration, that of all the motives
by which I am prompted to address you, that
which operates on me with the greatest force,
is, the consideration of the present state and
prospects of our country, and of the duty
which at so critical a moment presses imperiously
on every member of the community, to
exert his utmost powers in the public cause.</p>

<p class='c010'>That the Almighty Creator of the universe
governs the world which he has made; that
the sufferings of nations are to be regarded as
the punishment of national crimes; and their
decline and fall, as the execution of His sentence;
are truths which I trust are still generally
believed among us. Indeed to deny
them, would be directly to contradict the express
and repeated declarations of the Holy
Scriptures. If these truths be admitted, and
if it be also true, that fraud, oppression, and
cruelty, are crimes of the blackest dye, and
that guilt is aggravated in proportion as the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>criminal acts in defiance of clearer light, and
of stronger motives to virtue (and these are
positions to which we cannot refuse our assent,
without rejecting the authority not only of revealed,
but even of natural religion); have we
not abundant cause for serious apprehension?
The course of public events has, for many
years, been such as human wisdom and human
force have in vain endeavoured to controul or
resist. The counsels of the wise have been
infatuated; the valour of the brave has been
turned to cowardice. Though the storm has
been raging for many years, yet, instead of
having ceased, it appears to be now increasing
in fury; the clouds which have long
been gathering around us, have at length
almost overspread the whole face of the
heavens with blackness. In this very moment
of unexampled difficulty and danger, those
great political Characters, to the counsels of
the one or the other of whom the nation has
been used to look in all public exigencies,
have both been taken from us. If such be
our condition; and if the Slave Trade be a
national crime, declared by every wise and
respectable man of all parties, without exception,
to be a compound of the grossest wickedness
and cruelty, a crime to which we cling
in defiance of the clearest light, not only
in opposition to our own acknowledgments
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>of its guilt, but even of our own declared
resolutions to abandon it; is not this then
a time in which all who are not perfectly
sure that the Providence of God is but a
fable, should be strenuous in their endeavours
to lighten the vessel of the state, of
such a load of guilt and infamy?</p>

<p class='c010'>Urged by these various considerations, I
proceed to lay before you a summary of the
principal facts and arguments on which the
Abolitionists ground their cause, referring
such as may be desirous of more complete
information to various original records,<a id='r1' /><a href='#f1' class='c011'><sup>[1]</sup></a> and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>for a more detailed exposition of the reasonings
of the two parties, to the printed Report
of the Debates in Parliament,<a id='r2' /><a href='#f2' class='c011'><sup>[2]</sup></a> and to various
excellent publications which have from
time to time been sent into the world.<a id='r3' /><a href='#f3' class='c011'><sup>[3]</sup></a>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>The advocates for abolition court inquiry,
and are solicitous that their facts should be
thoroughly canvassed, and their arguments
maturely weighed.</p>

<p class='c010'>I fear I may have occasion to request your
accustomed candour, not to call it partiality,
for submitting to you a more defective statement
than you might reasonably require
from me. But when I inform you that I had
just entered on my present task when I was
surprized by the dissolution of Parliament, I
need scarcely add, that I have been of necessity
compelled to employ in a very different
manner the time which was to have been
allotted to this service. Under my present
circumstances, I had almost resolved to delay
addressing you till I could look forward to
a longer interval of leisure, than the speedily
approaching meeting of Parliament will now
allow me; but I hope that this address,
though it may be defective, will not be
erroneous. It may not contain all which I
might otherwise lay before you; but what
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>it does contain will be found, I trust, correct;
and if my address should bear the marks of
haste, I can truly assure you that the statements
and principles which I may hastily
communicate to you, have been most deliberately
formed, and have been often reviewed
with the most serious attention. But
I already foresee that my chief difficulty
will consist in comprising within any moderate
limits, the statements which my undertaking
requires, and the arguments to
be deduced from them; to select from the
immense mass of materials which lies before
me, such specimens of more ample details, as,
without exhausting the patience of my readers,
may convey to their minds some faint
ideas, faint indeed in colouring but just in
feature and expression, of the objects which
it is my office to delineate. If my readers
should at any time begin to think me prolix,
let them but call to mind the almost
unspeakable amount of the interests which
are in question, and they will more readily
bear with me.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Probable Effects of the Slave Trade.</div>

<p class='c010'>It might almost preclude the necessity of
inquiring into the actual effects of the Slave
Trade, to consider, arguing from the acknowledged
and never failing operation of
certain given causes, what must necessarily
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>be its consequences. How surely does a
demand for any commodities produce a supply.
How certainly should we anticipate
the multiplication of thefts, from any increase
in number of the receivers of stolen goods.
In the present instance, the demand is for
men, women, and children. And, can we
doubt that illicit methods will be resorted
to for supplying them? especially in a
country like Africa, imperfectly civilized,
and divided in general into petty communities?
We might almost anticipate with
certainty, the specific modes by which
the supply of Slaves is in fact furnished, and
foretell the sure effects on the laws, usages,
and state of society of the African continent.
But any doubts we might be willing
to entertain on this head are but too decisively
removed, when we proceed in the next
place to examine, what are the actual means
by which Slaves are commonly supplied, and
what are the Slave Trade’s known and ascertained
consequences? To this part of my
subject I intreat peculiar attention; the rather,
because I have often found an idea to
prevail; that it is the state of the Slaves in
the West Indies, the improvement of which
is the great object of the Abolitionists. On
the contrary, from first to last, I desire it
may be borne in mind, that Africa is the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span><em>primary</em> subject of our regard. It is the
effects of the Slave Trade on Africa, against
which chiefly we raise our voices, as constituting
a sum of guilt and misery, hitherto
unequalled in the annals of the world.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Evidence against the Slave Trade difficult to be procured.</div>

<p class='c010'>But, before I proceed to state the facts
themselves, which are to be laid before you,
it may be useful to make a few remarks
on the nature of the evidence by which they
are supported; and more especially on the
difficulties which it was reasonable to suppose
would be experienced in establishing,
by positive proof, the existence of practices
discreditable to the Slave Trade, notwithstanding
the great numbers of British ships
which for a very long period have annually
visited Africa, and the ample information
which on the first view might therefore appear
to lie open to our inquiries.</p>

<p class='c010'>Africa, it must be remembered, is a country
which has been very little visited from motives
of curiosity. It has been frequented,
almost exclusively, by those who have had
a direct interest in it’s peculiar traffic; as, the
agents and factors of the African Company,
or of individual Slave merchants, or by the
Captains and Officers of slave ships. The
situation of captain of an African ship is an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>employment, the unpleasant and even dangerous
nature of which must be compensated
by extraordinary profits. The same remark
extends in a degree to all the other officers of
slave ships; who, it should also be remarked,
may reasonably entertain hopes, if they recommend
themselves to their employers, of
rising to be Captains. They all naturally
look forward, therefore, to the command of
a ship, as the prize which is to repay them for
all their previous sacrifices and sufferings, and
some even of the Surgeons appear, in fact, to
have been promoted to it. Could these men
be supposed likely to give evidence against
the Slave Trade? nay, must not habit, especially
when thus combined with interest, be
presumed to have had it’s usual effect, in so
familiarizing them to scenes of injustice and
cruelty, as to prevent their being regarded
with any proportion of that disgust and
abhorrence which they would excite in any
mind not accustomed to them? In truth,
were the secrets of the prison-house ever so
bad, these men could not well be expected
to reveal them. But let it also be remembered,
that when the call for witnesses was
made by Parliament, the question of the
Abolition of the Slave Trade had become a
party question; and that all the West Indian
as well as the African property and influence
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>were combined together in it’s defence. The
supporters of the trade were the rich and the
powerful, the men of authority, influence and
connection. They had ships and factories and
counting houses, both at home and abroad.
Theirs it was, to employ shopkeepers and artizans;
theirs to give places of emolument, and the
means of rising in life. On the other hand, it
was but too obvious (I am sorry to say my
own knowledge fully justifies the remark)
that, in the great towns especially, in which
the African, or West Indian Trade, or both,
were principally carried on, any man who was
not in an independent situation, and who
should come forward to give evidence against
the Slave Trade, would expose himself and
his family to obloquy and persecution, perhaps
to utter ruin. He would become a
marked man, and be excluded from all opportunities
of improving his condition, or even
of acquiring a maintenance among his own
natural connections, and in his accustomed
mode of life. Any one who will duly weigh
the combined effect of all these circumstances,
will rather be surprized to hear that any of
those who had been actually engaged in carrying
on the Slave Trade, were found to give evidence
of it’s enormities, than that this description
of persons was not more numerous.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Evidence actually obtained.</div>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>For, notwithstanding all the obstacles to
which I have been alluding, much oral testimony
of the most valuable kind was obtained
from persons who had been engaged in the
actual conduct of the Slave Trade. And of by
far the greatest part of those witnesses it may
be truly said, that the more closely they were
examined, and the more strongly their evidence
was illustrated by light from other
quarters, the more was it’s truth decisively
established. So much I have thought it the
more necessary to observe; because insinuations,
to use the softest term, have been not
seldom cast against some of the witnesses
who gave evidence unfavourable to the Slave
Trade, before the House of Commons.—Happily,
however, some other sources of
information were discovered; and the exact
conformity of the intelligence derived from
these, with that which has been already
mentioned, gave to both indubitable confirmation.
A very few men of science were
found, who from motives of liberal curiosity
had visited those parts of the coast of
Africa where the Slave Trade was carried on.
Some few also of His Majesty’s naval and military
officers, who, while on service in Africa,
had opportunities of obtaining useful information
concerning the Slave Trade, consented
to be examined. They were indeed little
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>on shore, and they went to no great distance
within the country; but still the facts they
stated, were of the utmost importance; the
more so, because of the credit which they
reflect on the testimony of others, who, on
account of their inferior rank in life, might
in the judgment of some persons be more exceptionable
witnesses.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Other sources of information:—Old Authors.</div>

<p class='c010'>Lastly, there lay open to the Abolitionists
another source of information, to which great
attention was due; the acknowledged publications
of several persons who at different
periods had resided in Africa, some of them
for many years, and in high stations, in the
employ of the chief Slave trading Companies
of the various European nations, and
whose accounts had been given to the world
long before the Slave Trade had become a
subject of public discussion.</p>

<p class='c010'>It might indeed be presumed, that though
no attack had yet been made on the Slave
Trade, such persons would be disposed to
regard it with a partial and indulgent eye.
To it they had owed their fortunes; and,
even independently of all pecuniary interest,
no man likes to own that he is engaged in
a way of life which is hateful and dishonourable,
Still, if it be not the express purpose
of a narrative to deceive, the truth is apt to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>break out at intervals, and the Advocates for
Abolition might therefore expect to find some
indirect proofs, some occasional and incidental
notices of the real nature and effects of
the Slave Trade. They were at least entitled
to claim the full benefit of any facts to
the disparagement of the Slave Trade, which
should be found in this class of writings;
and where these earlier publications, of writers
so naturally biassed in favour of the
Slave Trade, should exactly accord, in what
they might state to it’s disparagement, with
other living witnesses, several of them, men
most respectable in rank and character, and
utterly uninterested either way in the decision
of the question concerning it’s abolition;
men too, whose testimony was the result of
their own personal knowledge; the facts
which should be thus proved, would be
established by a force of evidence, little
short of absolute demonstration.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Modern valuable information.</div>

<p class='c010'>Lastly, there are several other printed
accounts of Travels in Africa, which contain
much valuable information. The authors of
the publications here referred to, having visited
Africa of late years, can scarcely indeed be
said to be so unexceptionably free, as those
who wrote before the Slave Trade had become
a subject of public discussion, from all
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>bias, either from their connections, their
interest, or their preconceived opinions. No
imputation, however, is hereby intended to
be thrown out against them. With the character
of one of them, Dr. Winterbottom, I
have long been well acquainted, and it is
such as must alone entitle him to the full
credit which he has universally obtained.
But Mr. Parke justly stands at the head of
all African travellers. There prevails throughout
his work a remarkable air of authenticity,
and to all the facts which it contains, entire
credit is due. At the same time, I have
heard, from persons who saw his original
minutes, that they contained several statements
favourable to the views of the Abolitionists,
which are not inserted in the publication.
His work, however, must ever be
read with avidity, from its containing that
which perhaps of all human spectacles is the
most interesting, the exhibition of superior
energies, called into action by extraordinary
difficulties and dangers. Other publications
concerning Africa have since appeared. That
of Golberry, was drawn up and published
under the patronage of Bonaparte, about
the very time when the latter entered on his
crusade against the Blacks in St. Domingo;
the Abolitionists may therefore claim the benefit
of any facts to the discredit of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>Slave Trade which it contains. Barrow’s
highly interesting account of the Cape of
Good Hope, and his late work, containing the
account of the expedition to the Booshuana
country, reflect also much light on the
African character, and indirectly on the
effects of the Slave Trade.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Methods by which Slaves are supplied.</div>

<div class='sidenote'>Wars.</div>

<p class='c010'>Let us now proceed to examine what are
the principal sources from which the Slave
market is furnished with its supplies. The
result of that Inquiry will enable us to judge
what effect that traffic produces on the happiness
of Africa. A very large proportion of
the Slaves consists of prisoners of war. But
here it becomes advisable to rectify some
misconceptions, which have prevailed on this
head. The Abolitionists have been represented
as maintaining, that in Africa, wars
never arise from the various causes whence
wars have so commonly originated in the
other quarters of the globe; but that they
are undertaken solely for the purpose of obtaining
captives, who may be afterwards sold
for Slaves. In contradiction to this position,
various African wars have been cited,
which historians state to have arisen from
other causes; and it has been denied that
wars furnish any considerable supply to the
Slave market. Can it be necessary to declare,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>that the advocates for abolition never
made so foolish, as well as so false an assertion,
as that which has been thus imputed to
them? Africans are men—The same bad
passions therefore which have produced wars
among other communities of human beings,
produce the same wasteful effects in Africa
likewise. But it will greatly elucidate this
point to state, that, as we are informed by
Mr. Parke, who has travelled farther into the
interior of Africa than any modern traveller,
there are two kinds of war in Africa. The
one bears a resemblance to our European
contests, is openly avowed, and previously declared.
“This class however, we are assured, is
generally terminated in a single campaign.
A battle is fought; the vanquished seldom
think of rallying; the whole inhabitants
become panick struck; and the conquerors
have only to <em>bind their slaves</em>,<a id='r4' /><a href='#f4' class='c011'><sup>[4]</sup></a> and
carry off their plunder and their victims.”
These are taken into the country of the invader,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>whence, as opportunities offer, they are
sent to the Slave market.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Predatory expeditions.</div>

<p class='c010'>But the second kind of warfare, called
Tegria, which means, we are told, plundering
or stealing, and which appears to be no other
than the practice of predatory expeditions,
is that to which the Slave market is indebted
for its chief supplies, and which most clearly
explains the nature and effect of the Slave
Trade. Mr. Parke indeed tells us, that this
species of warfare arises from a sort of hereditary
feud, which subsists between the inhabitants
of neighbouring nations or districts.
If we take into the account that the avowed
compiler of Mr. Parke’s work, the patron to
whose good will he looked for the recompense
of all his labours, was one of the warmest and
most active opposers of the abolition of the
Slave Trade, we shall not wonder that the
fact alone is stated, without being traced to
it’s original cause. This however is a case, if
such a case ever existed, in which the features
of the offspring might alone enable us to recognise
the rightful parent. But in truth
we know from positive testimony, that
though hereditary feuds of the deadliest
malignity are but too surely generated by
these predatory expeditions, and consequently
that hatred and revenge may sometimes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>have a share in producing a continued
course of them, yet that, speaking
generally, the grand operating motive
from which they are undertaken, and to
which therefore, as their primary cause, they
may be referred, is the desire of obtaining
Slaves. “These predatory expeditions,” Mr.
Parke tells us, “are of all dimensions, from
500 horsemen, headed by the son of the
king of the country; to a single individual,
armed with his bow and arrow, who conceals
himself among the bushes, until
some young or unarmed person passes by.
He then, tyger-like, springs upon his
prey, drags his victim into the thicket,
and at night <em>carries him off as a slave</em>.”
(Vide note, p. <a href='#Page_19'>19</a>). “These incursions,” Mr.
Parke goes on to inform us, “are generally
conducted with great secresy; a few resolute
individuals, led by some person of
enterprize and courage, march quietly
through the woods, surprize in the night
some unprotected village, and <em>carry off the
inhabitants</em>, (vide note, p. <a href='#Page_19'>19</a>) and their effects,
before their neighbours can come to
their assistance.”—“One morning,” says
Mr. Parke, “during my residence at Kamalia,
we were all much alarmed by a
party of this kind. The prince of Focladoo’s
son, with a strong party of horse,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>passed secretly through the woods, a little
to the southward, and the next morning
plundered three towns belonging to a
powerful chief of Jollonkadoo. The success
of this expedition encouraged the governor
of another town to make a second
inroad on a part of the same country.
Having assembled about 200 of his people,
he passed the river in the night, and
<em>carried off a great number of prisoners</em>.
(Vide note, p. <a href='#Page_19'>19</a>). <em>Several of the inhabitants</em>
who had escaped these attacks, were <em>afterwards
seized</em> by the Mandingoes (<em>another
people</em>, let it be observed) as they wandered
about in the woods, or concealed themselves
in the glens and strong places in the
mountains.”</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Predatory expeditions very common.</div>

<p class='c010'>“These plundering excursions are very
common, and the inhabitants of different
communities watch every opportunity of
undertaking them.”—“They always,” as
Mr. Parke adds, “produce speedy retaliation;
and when large parties cannot be
collected for this purpose, a few friends
will combine together, and advance into
the enemy’s country, with a view to plunder,
<em>or carry off the inhabitants</em>.” (Note,
vide, pa. <a href='#Page_19'>19</a>). Thus hereditary feuds are
excited and perpetuated between different
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>nations, tribes, villages, and even families,
each waiting but for the favourable occasion
of accomplishing it’s revenge. Such is the
picture of the Interior of Africa, as it is
given by one who penetrated much further
inland than any other modern traveller, and
of whom it must be at least confessed, that
he was not disposed to exaggerate the evils
produced by the Slave Trade.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Sources of supply continued.</div>

<div class='sidenote'>Village-breaking.</div>

<p class='c010'>In another part of the country, we learn
from the most respectable testimony, a practice
prevails called Village-breaking. It is
precisely the Tegria of Mr. Parke, with this
difference, that though often termed making
war, it is acknowledged to be practised for
the express purpose of obtaining victims for
the Slave market. It is carried on, sometimes
by armed parties of individuals; sometimes
by the soldiers of the petty kings and
chieftains, who, perhaps in a season of
drunkenness, the consequences of which when
recovered from the madness of intoxication
they have themselves often most deeply deplored,
are instigated to become the plunderers
and destroyers of those very subjects
whom they were bound to protect. The
village is attacked in the night; if deemed
needful, to increase the confusion, it is set on
fire, and the wretched inhabitants, as they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>are flying naked from the flames, are seized
and carried into slavery. This practice,
especially when conducted on a smaller scale,
is called <em>panyaring</em>; <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Panyaring, or kidnapping.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
for the practice has
long been too general not to have created
the necessity of an appropriate term. It is
sometimes practised by Europeans, especially
when the ships are passing along the coast,
or when their boats, in going up the rivers,
can seize their prey without observation; in
short, whenever there is a convenient opportunity
of carrying off the victims, and concealing
the crime: and the unwillingness
which the natives universally shew to venture
into a ship of war, until they are convinced
it is not a Slave ship, contrasted with the
freedom and confidence with which they then
come on board, is thus easily accounted for<a id='r5' /><a href='#f5' class='c011'><sup>[5]</sup></a>.
But these depredations are far more commonly
perpetrated by the natives on each
other; and on a larger or a smaller scale,
according to the power and number of the
assailants, and the resort of ships to the
coast, it prevails so generally, as, throughout
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>the whole extent of Africa, to render person
and property utterly insecure.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Allegation, “that a small proportion of Slaves are prisoners of war,” considered.</div>

<p class='c010'>And here, before we proceed to other
sources of supply, let us for a moment recur
to the assertions formerly mentioned, on
which our opponents lay very considerable
stress,—that but a small proportion of the
whole supply of the market consists of
prisoners of war, and that African wars do
not often originate from the desire of obtaining
Slaves. Should we even concede these
points, we are now abundantly qualified to
estimate the force of the concession; for
though we should grant, that declared and
national wars are not often undertaken for
the purpose of obtaining Slaves, yet it is at
least equally undeniable, that those predatory
expeditions which are so common, and
of which it is the express object to acquire
Slaves, are often productive of national wars
on the largest scale, and of the most destructive
consequences; while they also are
the sure and abundant cause of those incessant
quarrels and hereditary feuds, which are
said to be universal in Africa, and which acts
of mutual outrage cannot fail to generate, in
countries where the artificial modes of controlling
and terminating the disputes and
hostilities of adverse tribes and nations are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>unknown. It appears also, that wars are in
Africa rendered singularly cruel and wasteful,
by the peculiar manner in which they are
carried on. So that though we cannot fairly
lay to the charge of the Slave Trade all the
wars of Africa, we yet may allege that to
the causes which produce wars elsewhere,
the Slave Trade superadds one entirely new
and constant source of great copiousness and
efficiency, while it gives to the wars, which
arise from every other cause, a character of
peculiar malignity and desolation. But
happy even, from what has been already
stated, happy would it be for Africa, if her
greatest miseries were those of avowed and
open warfare. War, though the greatest
scourge of other countries, is a light evil in
the African estimate of suffering. Direct and
avowed wars will happen but occasionally, as
the circumstances which produce them may
arise. Wars, besides, between uncivilized
nations, scarcely ever last long; those of
Africa, Mr. Parke tells us, seldom beyond a
single campaign; and the very consciousness
that an evil will be of short duration, mitigates
the pain which it occasions. But it is not of
accidental or temporary injuries that Africa
complains. Her miseries, severe in degree,
are also permanent; they know neither intervals
or remissions.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Sources of supply continued.</div>

<div class='sidenote'>Administration of justice.</div>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>But the Slave Trade is not sustained exclusively
by acts of hostile outrage. The administration
of justice is turned into another
engine for its supply. The punishments, as we
are told by some of the old writers,<a id='r6' /><a href='#f6' class='c011'><sup>[6]</sup></a> were
formerly remarkable for their lenity; but by
degrees, they have been moulded, especially
on the coast, into a more productive form.
The most trifling offences are punished by
the fine of one or more Slaves, which if the
culprit be unable to pay, he himself is to be
sold into slavery, often for the benefit of the
very judges by whom he is condemned.<a id='r7' /><a href='#f7' class='c011'><sup>[7]</sup></a> When
the necessity for obtaining Slaves becomes
more pressing, new crimes are fabricated,
accusations and convictions are multiplied;
the unwary are artfully seduced into the
commission of crimes. The imaginary offence
of witchcraft becomes often a copious source
of supply, a conviction being punished by
the sale of the whole family.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Native superstitions: Witchcraft.</div>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>Indeed, on some parts of the country bordering
on the coast, this charge furnishes the
ready means of obtaining, especially for a
chieftain, the supply of European articles.
A person accused of this crime is required
to purge himself by the ordeal of drinking
what is called ‘red water’. If the accused
drinks it with impunity, he is declared innocent,
but if, as more commonly happens, the
red water being generally medicated for the
purpose, the party is taken sick, or dies, in general
the whole, or at the least a certain number
of his family, are immediately sold into
slavery. An eye witness, who stated the effects
of this system, mentioned his having
seen king Sherbro, the chief of the river
of that name, kill six persons in that way
in a single morning. In some extensive districts
near the windward coast of Africa,
almost every death is believed by the natives
to be occasioned by magical influence; and
the belief, it is difficult to say, whether real
or pretended, in this superstition, is carried
to such an extent as to break every tie of
natural affection. In these districts it is estimated
that two-thirds of the whole export
of Slaves were sold for witchcraft. Every
man who has acquired any considerable property,
or who has a large family, the sale of
which will produce a considerable profit, excites
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>in the Chieftain near whom he resides,
the same longings which are called forth in
the wild beast, by the exhibition of his proper
prey, and he himself lives in a continual
state of suspicion and terror.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Famine and Insolvency.</div>

<p class='c010'>To this long catalogue are to be added
two other sources, famines, and insolvency.
In times of extreme scarcity, persons sometimes
sell themselves for subsistence; and still
more frequently, it is said, children are sold
by their parents to procure provisions for
the rest of the family. These famines,
Mr. Parke, who mentions this source of
slavery, observes, are often produced by wars.
But while on the one hand we must remark,
that this effect arises chiefly out of that peculiarly
wasteful manner of carrying on war
in Africa, which we have already noticed; so
may we not fairly presume that to the Slave
Trade also, and to the habits of mind which
it generates, it is to be ascribed, that in such
seasons of general distress, he who possesses
food refuses to part with so much as will
suffice for the bare maintenance of his neighbours
and fellow sufferers, at any price except
that of selling themselves or their children
into perpetual slavery? With respect to debt
or insolvency, the laws respecting debtor and
creditor which prevail in Africa, furnish a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>striking illustration of the effect of the Slave
Trade, in gradually moulding to it’s own
purpose all the institutions and habits of the
country in which it prevails, and rendering
them instrumental in forwarding the grand
object of furnishing a supply for the Slave
market. Creditors, in compensation of their
claims on the debtor, have not only a right
to seize his own person, and sell him for a
Slave, but also any of his family; and if he
or they cannot be taken, any inhabitants of
the same village, or, as Mr. Parke says, any
native of the same kingdom. Indeed it is
very rarely that the debtor himself is molested,
it is his neighbours or townsmen who
are the sufferers. Hence persons become
debtors more freely, because, while they
gratify their appetites by obtaining the European
goods they want, they are not likely
to pay for their rashness in their own persons.
The Captains of Slave ships are in their turn
less backward in advancing goods on credit
to the Black factors, and they again to other
native dealers, knowing that from some quarter
or another the Slaves will surely be supplied.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Distinctions between the Interior countries, and those on the Coast.</div>

<p class='c010'>In giving this general account of the manner
of procuring Slaves, it ought to be observed,
that the number and extent of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>countries whence the Slaves are furnished,
and their varying circumstances, will doubtless
occasion some variations in the manner
of carrying on the traffic: still we might
presume that the same causes, operating for
a long course of years, on human beings, in
something like the same rude state of society,
would produce nearly similar effects. In
fact we find, from positive testimony, that
there is this general similarity in the consequences
of the Slave Trade wherever it exists.
But there is one distinction which ought to
be noticed, that between the inland countries
and those on the coast. The proportion furnished
by them respectively varies in different
parts of Africa; but every where the
greater number is supplied from the interior.
Many of them come from great distances
inland, and the sufferings of these
unhappy beings during their journey are
such as would alone, if the voice of humanity
were to be heard, prompt us to abandon at
once so horrid a traffic. Mr. Parke travelled
down with a small party of them; and hard
indeed must be the heart of that man who
can read his account without shuddering.</p>

<p class='c010'>The difference between the circumstances
of the inland districts and those adjacent to
the coast, will of course create some corresponding
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>difference in the effects produced
on them by the Slave Trade. In the interior
of the country, the kingdoms, though
even they are often split into a number of
independent states, are generally of greater
extent than on the coast, which is often,
especially on the Windward and Gold
coast, separated into numberless petty communities,
under their respective Chieftains
or Aristocracies. It should likewise be remarked,
that on one extensive part of the
coast of Africa which is divided into a number
of different states, every black or white
factor who has acquired a little property,
forms a settlement or village, and becomes
a petty chieftain, and carries on against his
neighbours a predatory warfare, by which
they are of course excited to reciprocal acts
of hostility. In the interior, acts of depredation
on members of another community,
though, as we are told, very common, are
not near so frequent as on the coast; except,
perhaps, on the boundaries of kingdoms: and
it is remarkable, that Mr. Parke informs
us, that the boundaries even of the most
populous and powerful kingdoms are commonly
very ill peopled. On members of the
same community also, these depredations,
though undoubtedly frequent, are for many
reasons much less common than in the countries
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>bordering on the shore. The concealment
of any such act of rapine would be
obviously much more difficult; neither might
it be easy for private traders to secrete their
victims, during the long interval which might
elapse, before an opportunity might offer of
disposing of them. Again, the chieftains or
kings of these large communities, while on
the one hand, their more abundant revenues
place them above the necessity of resorting to
such ruinous means of supplying their wants,
as the pillage of their own villages, so on the
other, not coming into immediate contact
with the Slave Traders, they are not so liable
to be suddenly instigated, in the madness of
intoxication, to the commission of such outrages.
The same difference in the circumstances
of the interior, prevents the administration
of justice, or the native superstitions,
being resorted to in the same degree as on
the coast. And it is remarkable, that though
Mr. Parke speaks of crimes as one source of
supply to the Slave Trade, we do not find in
his narrative, one single instance specified
of a Slave having been so furnished. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Evils of Slave Trade aggravated on the Coast.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
But,
above all, let it be remembered, on the coast
the grand repository of temptations is palpable,
and on the spot; of temptations commonly
of that precise kind, which, by the
gratifications they hold out to the depraved
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>appetites, and bad passions of man, spirituous
liquors, gunpowder, and fire-arms, the
incentives to acts of violence, and the means
of committing them, are apt to operate most
powerfully on uncivilized men. The love of
spirituous liquors, is a passion also, which
becomes from indulgence, more craving, and
difficult to be resisted. The Captains of Slave
ships, who are sound practical philosophers,
thoroughly conversant, at least, with all the
bad parts of human nature, are well aware of
these propensities, and of the advantages
which may be derived from them; and hence,
they often begin by giving to the petty king
or chieftain a present of brandy or rum,
anticipating the large returns for this liberality,
which future acts of depredation will
supply. It is almost a happy circumstance
when the chieftain, by possessing the implements
of war, is tempted to revenge some old
injury, or to ravage and carry off the inhabitants
of some neighbouring district, instead
of preying on his own miserable subjects.
Meanwhile the Slave factor himself takes no
part in the quarrels between contending chieftains,
but which party soever is victorious,
he finds his advantage in the war. He supplies
all the contending parties with fire-arms
and ammunition, and receives all the Slaves
which are made on both sides with perfect
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>impartiality. Under such circumstances,
might we not anticipate, what we know from
positive evidence, that the factor stirs up and
inflames dissensions, from which, whoever else
may be the loser, he is sure to gain. It has
been even imputed to neighbouring chiefs,
who, assisted by their respective allies, have
carried on with each other a long protracted
war, that by a mutual understanding, they have
abstained from wasting each other’s territories,
while each carried on his ravages against the
allies of his enemy with great activity and
success. But it is not to kings or chieftains
only, that the Slave Trade holds out strong
temptations. The appetite for spirituous
liquors is universal. European commodities
are coveted by all. Whether for attack or
defence, fire-arms and gunpowder are most
desirable. In such a loose state of society,
almost every one has some malice to wreak,
some injury to retaliate. Thus sensuality,
avarice, hostility, revenge, every bad passion
is called into action; while there lies the
Slave ship, ready to receive old and young,
males and females, all in short who are
brought to it, and, without question or exception,
to furnish the desired gratification in
return. The Captains of Slave ships themselves,
who gave evidence before the House
of Commons, frankly and invariably acknowledged,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>that it is the universal practice, if the
price can be agreed on, to purchase all who
are brought to them, without examination as
to the manner in which the Slave has been
obtained, as to his former condition, or the
vendor’s right to sell. So well did they
seem to be aware how much the success of
their traffic might depend on this mode of
conducting it, that they even resented it as
an insult on their understandings, when they
were asked whether any questions of this
kind were put by the purchaser. Thus, whenever
a Slave ship is on the coast, a large and
general premium is immediately held out for
the perpetration of acts of fraud, violence,
and rapine. Every child, every unprotected
female that can be seized on, can be immediately
turned to account. No wonder that,
as Captain Wilson informs us, the inhabitants
are afraid of venturing out of their own doors
without being armed; a practice of which one
of themselves gave him the explanation, by
significantly pointing to a Slave ship which
then lay in sight, completing her cargo.</p>

<p class='c010'>But it is not only without doors that the
Slave ship holds out its lure; it is not only
by open violence that it operates. When
the Slave ships arrive, unjust convictions are
multiplied. Accusations for witchcraft become
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>frequent. And it is well worthy of
remark, that these native superstitions, being
thus maintained in continued life and action,
have continued in full force in those very
districts, where the intercourse of the natives
with the Europeans has been the longest, and
the most intimate; while in the interior, the
same barbarous practices have either gone
into decay of themselves, or seem to have
faded away before the feeble light of Mahometanism.
Even among private families the
seeds of insecurity and cruelty are copiously
sown; and from the pressure of present
temptation, a husband or a master is often
induced, in a fit of temporary anger or jealousy,
to sell his wife or his domestics, whom
afterwards he often in vain wishes he could
recover.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Practice of receiving relations as pawns, and consequences of it.</div>

<p class='c010'>But besides these general and powerfully
operating causes of evil, which have been
already noticed, there is one circumstance
in the manner of conducting the trade on the
coast, which so naturally tends to the production
of frequent acts of violence, as to
deserve a distinct specification. It affords
another striking instance of the way in which
the Slave Trade has in a long course of years
gradually imparted a taint to all the institutions
and customs of Africa. It is the general
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>custom for Captains of Slave ships, in
exchange for the goods which they advance
on credit, and of which the value, as has been
stated, is to be repaid to them in Slaves, to
receive the children or some other near relations
of the Black Factor as pledges, or as
they are termed in Africa <em>pawns</em>, whom the
Slave captains are to return when the stipulated
number of Slaves has been delivered.
With the goods which have been entrusted
to him he commonly goes up the country;
and, knowing that by some means or other
the requisite number of Slaves must be furnished,
or that his own nearest relatives, and
he himself too if he can be taken, will be
carried off into slavery, it is obvious, that
when the day for the sailing of the ship draws
nigh, he will not be very scrupulous in the
means to which he resorts for completing his
assortment. Thus even parental instinct and
the domestic and social affections are rendered
by the Slave Trade the incentives to
acts of cruelty and rapine. But it would be
endless were I to attempt to lay before you
in detail all the various forms and modes of
wickedness, and misery, of which, directly and
indirectly, the Slave Trade is productive. It’s
general and leading features have been now
exhibited to you.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Recapitulation of effects of Slave Trade.</div>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>Such are the methods by which from eighty
to one hundred thousand of our fellow creatures,
a race of people too, declared by Mr.
Parke himself, to be perhaps beyond all
others, passionately attached to their native
soil, are annually torn from their country,
their homes, their friends, and from
whatever is most dear to them. All the ties
of nature, and habit, and feeling, are burst
asunder; and, by a long voyage, the horrors
of which were acknowledged to constitute of
themselves an almost incalculable sum of
misery, these victims of our injustice are carried
to a distant land, to wear away the
whole remainder of their lives in a state of
hopeless slavery and degradation, with the
same melancholy prospect for their descendants
after them, for ever.</p>

<p class='c010'>Yet even this is not all. There is one consequence
of the Slave Trade, a consequence
too, most important to Africa, which still
remains to be pointed out. It were much to
foment and aggravate, not seldom to produce,
long and bloody wars—to incite to
incessant acts of the most merciless
depredation—to poison and embitter the administration
of the laws—and in general, to
give a malignant taint to religious and civil
institutions; thus, turning into engines of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>oppression and misery, that very machinery
of the social state, which is naturally conducive
to the protection and comfort of mankind.
It is much to compel men to live at
home amid the alarm, elsewhere only felt,
and with the precautions only used in an
enemy’s country,—to hold out a direct premium
to rapine and murder,—in short, to
produce the general prevalence of selfishness,
and fraud, and violence, and cruelty, and
terror, and revenge. And all this; not on a
small scale, or within narrow limits, but
throughout an immense region, bounded by
a line of coast of between three and four
thousand miles, and stretching inland to
various depths, not seldom to a distance
which it requires several months to travel.
But there is one triumph still behind;
one effect of the Slave Trade; which, if it
excite not at first the same lively sympathy,
as some others of it’s more direct outrages,
on the comforts of domestic or the peace of
social life, will yet, in the deliberate judgment
of a considerate mind, appear on reflection
to be of more importance than all
the rest. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Another most important consequence of the Slave Trade.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
This is, that by keeping in a state
of incessant insecurity, of person and property,
the whole of the district which is
visited by Europeans, we maintain an impassable
barrier on that side, through which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>It prevents the civilization of Africa.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
alone any rays of the religious and moral
light and social improvements of our happier
quarter of the globe might penetrate into the
interior, and thus lock up the whole of
that vast continent in it’s present state of
wretchedness and darkness.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>No natural death of the Slave Trade.</div>

<p class='c010'>Here, then, we see the bitter cup of Africa
filled to the very brim. For the above consideration
shews but too clearly, that she
cannot expect any natural termination of her
sufferings from the gradual progress of civilization
and knowledge, which have, in some
other instances, put a period to a less extended
traffic for Slaves in countries differently
situated. The very channels through which
alone, according to all human calculation,
Africa might have hoped to receive the
blessings of religious and moral light, and
social improvement, are precisely those
through which her miseries flow in upon her
with so full a tide. Thus the African Slave
Trade provides for it’s own indefinite continuance.
Here also, as in other instances which
have been already pointed out, it turns into
poison what has been elsewhere most salutary,
and renders that very intercourse, which has
been ordinarily the grand means of civilization,
the most sure and operative instrument,
in the perpetuation of barbarism.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Our aggravated guilt.</div>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>At length, then, we are prepared to form
some judgment of the effects of European
intercourse on the state and happiness of
Africa. The darkness of Paganism were a
very insufficient palliation of such a tissue
of cruelty and crimes. But surely it is no
small aggravation of our guilt, that We, who
are the prime agents in this traffic of wickedness
and blood, are ourselves the most free,
enlightened, and happy people that ever
existed upon earth. We profess a religion
which inculcates truth and love, peace and
good-will, among men—We are foremost in a
commerce which exists but by war, treachery,
and devastation. We enjoy a political constitution
of government, eminent above all
others for securing to the very meanest and
weakest the blessings of civil liberty, of personal
security, and equal laws—yet We take
the lead in maintaining this accursed system,
which begins in fraud and violence, and is
consummated in bondage and degradation.
Blessed ourselves with religious light and
knowledge, we prolong in Africa the reign
of ignorance and superstition. In short, instead
of endeavouring to diffuse among
nations, less favoured than ourselves, the
blessings we enjoy; after our crime has been
indisputably proved to us, in defiance alike
of conscience and of reputation, we industriously
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>and perseveringly continue to deprave
and darken the Creation of God.</p>

<p class='c010'>There is scarcely any point of view in
which the nature and effects of our intercourse
with Africa will appear so peculiarly
disgraceful to us as a christian nation, as
when we contemplate them in connection
with the benefits which the Africans derive
from their intercourse with the Mahometans.
When we cast our eyes towards the
south-west of Europe, and behold extensive
countries, once possessed by the most polished
nations, the chosen seats of literature
and the liberal arts; and now behold one
universal waste of ignorance and barbarism,
we have always been accustomed to ascribe
the fatal change to the conquest of a band
of Mahometan invaders, and to regret that
such fine countries should remain under the
benumbing effects of a Mussulman government.
On the other hand, in contemplating
the superior state of our northern parts of
Europe, we have been used, with reason, to
ascribe much of our light and liberty, and
many of our various blessings, to the influence
of that pure religion which is the friend
of freedom, of peace, and good-will among men.
But with what shame must we acknowledge,
that in Africa, Christianity and Mahometanism
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>appear to have mutually interchanged
characters.—Smith, the African Company’s
own agent in 1722, tells us, “the discerning
natives account it their greatest unhappiness
that they were ever visited by the
Europeans. They say that we Christians
introduced the traffic of Slaves, and that
before our coming they lived in peace.
But, say they, it is observable, that wherever
Christianity comes, there come with
it, a sword, a gun, powder and ball.”<a id='r8' /><a href='#f8' class='c011'><sup>[8]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>The same picture may appear to claim
still greater attention from the hand of Mr.
Parke, whose visit is more recent, and whose
knowledge of Africa is more extensive.—Speaking
of the Foulah nation, who are many
of them professed Mahometans, he says,
“religious persecution is not known among
them, nor is it necessary, for the system
of Mahomet is made to extend itself by
means abundantly more efficacious. By
establishing small schools in the different
towns, where many of the Pagan as well
as Mahometan children are taught to read
the Koran, and instructed in the tenets
of the prophet, the Mahometan priests
fix a bias on the minds, and form the character
of their young disciples, which no
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>accidents of life can ever afterwards remove
or alter. Many of these little schools
I visited in my progress through the country,
and observed with pleasure the great
docility, and submissive deportment of
the children, and heartily wished they
had had better instructors, and a purer religion.”
Again, speaking of the Mandingo
country, and of other parts of Africa,
and of the eagerness which the natives,
both Pagan and Mahometan, shew to acquire
some knowledge of letters, Mr. Parke
speaks out still more intelligibly, and appears
feelingly alive to the humiliation of his own
religion; and, from motives of christian
zeal as well as of humanity, he recommends
our endeavouring to introduce the light of
true religion into that benighted land.<a id='r9' /><a href='#f9' class='c011'><sup>[9]</sup></a> “Although,”
says he, “the negroes in general
have a very great idea of the wealth and
power of the Europeans, I am afraid that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>the Mahometan converts among them
think but very lightly of our superior attainments
in religious knowledge. The
white traders in the maritime districts
take no pains to counteract this unhappy
prejudice.”—“To me, therefore, it was not
so much the subject of wonder, as matter
of regret, to observe, that while the superstition
of Mahomet has in this manner
scattered a few faint beams of learning
among these poor people, the precious light
of Christianity is altogether excluded. I
could not but lament, that although the
coast of Africa has now been known and
frequented by the Europeans for more
than two hundred years, yet the negroes
still remain entire strangers to the doctrines
of our holy religion.”— “The poor Africans,
whom we affect to consider as barbarians,
look upon us, I fear, as little better
than a race of formidable but ignorant
Heathens.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Such was Smith’s relation, near a century
ago, of the judgment formed by the Africans,
of the effects of their intercourse with the
Christian nations. Such is the acknowledgment
of Mr. Parke, who is certainly disposed
to paint the effects of the Slave Trade in the
softest colours. Is it possible for any one
who calls himself a Christian, and a member
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>of the British Empire, to read the passage
without the deepest humiliation and sorrow,
and without longing also, not only to stop
the guilty commerce we have so long carried
on, but to endeavour to repair, in some
degree, the wrongs of Africa, and with active
but tardy kindness, to impart to her
some small share of the overflowings of our
superabundant blessings?</p>

<p class='c010'>“But surely,” you will long ere now have
been ready to exclaim, “Surely the facts which
you have laid before us, though believed by
the abolitionists, could not have been established
in the judgment of the majority of
the House of Commons;”—and you may
justly require some decisive evidence in proof
of them.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Evidence by which the above statements are established.</div>

<p class='c010'>To adduce all the specific testimony by
which the above allegations were established,
would be to fill a volume. I mean, as a
specimen of the whole, to extract, and subjoin
in an appendix, a few passages from
the vast body of evidence with which
we are furnished on this subject. But it
would be injustice to the great cause I am
pleading, not to declare, that the above
statements were established beyond all possible
dispute; and also, that, with occasional
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>variations, resulting from the difference
in the forms of government, and in other
circumstances, they were found to be applicable
not to particular parts only of Africa,
but to the whole of that vast district which is
visited by the European Slave ships; to be,
not the exception, but the rule; not the occasional,
but the general and systematic effects
of the Slave Trade ships. We have the
evidence of several most respectable Officers
of the navy, to prove, that wherever they
touched, acts of depredation were common.
The same practices were found to prevail
in the widely distant countries of Senegambia
and the Gold coast, by men of Science, one
of whom produced a journal, kept at the
time, in which he daily entered all that
appeared to him worthy of remark; and it
was from this record that the Committee
read the affecting account which has been
mentioned, in which one of the African
Kings, with every appearance of sincerity,
repeatedly expressed his deep remorse for
having been instigated, in a season of intoxication,
into which he had been drawn by the
Slave merchants, to oppress and pillage his
subjects. Much of the Abolitionists’ information
was also obtained from those who,
in different capacities, chiefly as surgeons,
more commonly as mates, and in some few
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>instances as common sailors, had been actually
employed in Slave ships; some of
these persons had likewise been for many
months on shore among the natives; and
several of them had witnessed the practice of
attacking villages by armed parties in the
night, and carrying away, and selling all
they could seize.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Opponents’ contrary evidence.</div>

<p class='c010'>In opposition to all this testimony, the
Slave Traders produced several witnesses, who
were either still engaged in the Slave Trade,
or who had formerly carried it on, some of
whom had resided several years in Slave factories
on the coast. By them it was generally
declared, that acts of depredation for the purpose
of procuring Slaves were never committed;
they had never even heard of such practices,
nor had they ever heard of the practice,
or of the term, of panyaring or kidnapping.<a id='r10' /><a href='#f10' class='c011'><sup>[10]</sup></a>
Crimes and witchcraft were said to be the
chief sources of supply; a few were furnished
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>by insolvency. The trials were said to be
fair, the convictions just. In short, according
to their report, the Africans, of whose natural
dispositions and character they at the same
time gave a highly unfavourable representation,
and whose government was said to be
very loose and imperfect, must have been a
people of the most extraordinary moral excellency,
who had for centuries resisted present
and strong temptations, which in every
other country had proved too powerful to be
successfully opposed. Such, according to
these witnesses, was the state of things on the
coast. Of the interior, from whence the
greater part of the Slaves were brought, they
professed to know little or nothing.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Opponents’ evidence decisively refuted.</div>

<p class='c010'>The allegations of these persons, even
though they had not been effectually disproved
by the concurrent testimony of the
various classes of witnesses already noticed,
carried their refutation on the very face of
them. But if any doubts could have been
entertained to which of the two accounts
most credit was due, to that of men who were
still concerned in carrying on the Slave
Trade, or had made their fortunes by it,
on the one side; and of witnesses on the other,
most of whom, highly respectable both in
point of rank and character, had no interest
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>at stake either way; these doubts would
have been completely removed by another
branch of evidence. For, happily for the
cause of truth and justice, we were able to
adduce, in support of our allegations, the
testimony of another set of witnesses, against
whom our opponents at least could urge no
objections, <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Especially
by accounts
of Africa,
published
by Slave
Traders,
and before
the Slave
Trade had
been
attacked.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
persons in the employ of the
African Company or of private merchants,
who had been long resident in Africa, for the
express purpose of carrying on the Slave
Trade, and who, as was formerly mentioned,
had published to the world the result of their
observations and experience. It might indeed
have been feared, that we should be compelled
to except against their testimony; and
it must be confessed, that for the sake of their
own credit, and for that of the occupation by
which they had made their fortunes, they
would naturally be disposed, even in acknowledging
abuses, to touch them with a tender
and favourable hand. Yet, however short of
the truth we may reasonably suppose their
representations to fall, where they are discreditable
to the Slave Trade, we find our charges
positively and abundantly proved.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Slave Trade’s cruelty and guilt acknowledged by the parliamentary opposers of the abolition.</div>

<p class='c010'>But it is due to our opponents themselves
in the House of Commons, excepting only
such of them as were personally connected
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>with the places whence the Slave Trade is
principally carried on, who are allowed a
certain license of speaking and reasoning, on
the ground of their being understood to utter
the language of their constituents rather than
their own; to the rest even of our opponents
it is due, to declare, that they never for a
moment affected to entertain a doubt of the
substantial correctness of our statements.
Of the injustice and inhumanity of the Slave
Trade, there was but one opinion. The chief
advocates for gradual abolition, and even the
very few who resisted abolition in any form,
reprobated the traffic in the plainest and
strongest terms; avowing their firm conviction
of its incurable wickedness and cruelty.
One of them declared that he knew no language
which could add to its horrors; another,
that in the pursuit of the general object
he felt equally warm with the Abolitionists
themselves; another acknowledged
the Slave Trade was the disgrace of Great
Britain, and the torment of Africa. Whatever
might be thought of the consistency of
our opponents, who, after thus admitting our
premises, stopped short of the conclusions to
which such premises might be thought infallibly
to lead, it was no great stretch of candour
in them to speak in such terms of the
Slave Trade, when, so clearly indisputable
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>were it’s nature and effects, that Mr. Bryan
Edwards, one of the ablest, and most determined
enemies of abolition, while avowedly
opposing the measure in an eloquent speech
(which was afterwards published by authority)
made the following memorable declaration.
After having confessed he had not the
smallest doubt that <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Mr. Bryan Edward’s declaration to the same effect.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
“in Africa the effects of
the Slave Trade were precisely such as I
had represented them to be;” he added,
“the whole or the greatest part of that immense
continent, is a field of warfare and
desolation; a wilderness, in which the inhabitants
are wolves towards each other;
a scene of oppression, fraud, treachery, and
blood.”—“The assertion, that a great
many of the slaves are criminals and convicts,
is mockery and insult.”</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Pleas against abolition.</div>

<p class='c010'>But if the charges which the Abolitionists
brought against the Slave Trade were thus
clearly proved, you may now be much more
disposed to wonder, what arguments could be
found sufficiently strong to induce the House
of Commons of Great Britain to hesitate,
even for a moment, to wipe away so foul a
blot from our national character.</p>

<p class='c010'>The grand operating consideration, which,
from the very first discussion of the question
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>in 1791 to the present moment, has prevented
the actual abolition of the Slave Trade,
though so long a period has elapsed since
Mr. Pitt congratulated the House of Commons,
the Country, and the World, that
“its sentence was sealed, that it had received
it’s condemnation,” has undoubtedly been,
the persuasion that it’s continuance is necessary
to the well-being of our West Indian
colonies. We will, therefore, inquire into
that necessity. But as several other allegations
were set up, and various arguments
urged, on the part of the Slave Traders, it
may be best to consider, previously, such of
them as are included in the African division
of the subject, in order to clear the way for
what may be termed, the West Indian branch
of the subject.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The Negroes an inferior race.</div>

<p class='c010'>The advocates for the Slave Trade originally
took very high ground; contending, that
the Negroes were an inferior race of beings.
It is obvious, that, if this were once acknowledged,
they might be supposed, no less than
their fellow brutes, to have been comprised
within the original grant of all inferior creatures
to the use and service of man. A position
so shameless, and so expressly contradicted
by the Holy Scriptures, could not long
be maintained in plain terms. But many
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>others, which may not improperly be supposed,
from their features, to belong to the
same family, were afterwards brought forward.
To this class belong the assertions,
that, though it might scarcely be justifiable to
withhold from the Africans the name of men,
yet that they were manifestly inferior to the
rest of the human species, both in their intellectual
and moral powers. Hence, doubtless,
it was, that they never had attained to
any height of civilization; whence it was also
inferred, that they never could be civilized;
that therefore they might be reasonably regarded,
as intended by Providence to be
the hewers of wood and drawers of water of
the species; as a race originally destined to
servile offices, and fairly applicable to any
purpose by which they might be rendered
most subservient to the interest and comfort
of the Lords of the Creation. This, indeed,
was high ground, as has been already remarked;
but it was not injudiciously selected,
had it been but tenable; for our opponents
well knew, that could they but obtain credit
for their representations of the incorrigible
stupidity and depravity of the Negro race,
our commiseration of them would be proportionably
lessened, and then all, except
perhaps a few stubborn advocates for justice
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>in the abstract, would be content to leave
them to their fate.</p>

<p class='c010'>It therefore becomes highly interesting, in
a practical point of view, to ascertain the
real character and qualities, both intellectual
and moral, of the natives of Africa; and, remembering
the advantages we derived in a
former instance, from publications which had
appeared before the Slave Trade became a
subject of public discussion, we might be disposed
to congratulate ourselves in having
access, on the present occasion, to a work
which was published many years before any
proposition had been brought forward for
abolishing the Slave Trade. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Mr. Long’s account of the Negro race.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
The publication
to which I allude is Mr. Long’s elaborate
History of Jamaica, a work which has been
long regarded as of the highest authority on
all West Indian topics. We may consider
it as containing a more fair representation
of the opinion entertained of the Negroes,
and of the estimation in which they were
held by the well-informed colonists, than
any statements which, having been subsequently
made, may be supposed to have
received a tincture from that discussion.
Mr. Long’s work appeared long before the
necessity of vindicating the Slave Trade, and
the difficulty of finding arguments for that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>purpose had driven the enemies of abolition
to the unworthy expedient of calumniating
the African character. Yet we find this
commonly respectable author speaking of
the race of Negroes in such terms, as they
who have read the more recent accounts of
Africa will peruse with astonishment, as well
as with disgust. Far be it from me to quote
them with any design of injuring the reputation
of a work of established credit. But the
passages are in several points of view highly
important, and well deserving of your most
serious consideration.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Extracts from Long’s History of Jamaica.</div>

<p class='c010'>“For my own part (says Mr. Long) I think
there are extremely potent reasons for believing
that the white and the negro are two distinct
species.” “In general (he goes on) the
African negroes are void of genius, and seem
almost incapable of making any progress in
civility or science. They have no plan or
system of morality among them. Their barbarity
to their children debases their nature
even below that of brutes. They have no
moral sensations; no taste, but for women,
gormandizing and drinking to excess; no
wish but to be idle. Their children, from
their tenderest years, are suffered to deliver
themselves up to all that nature suggests to
them. Their houses are miserable cabins.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>They conceive no pleasure from the most
beautiful parts of their country, preferring
the most sterile. Their roads, as they call
them, are mere sheep paths, twice as long
as they need be, and almost impassable.
Their country in most parts is one continued
wilderness, beset with briars and thorns.</p>

<p class='c010'>“They use neither carriages nor beasts
of burthen. They are represented <em>by all
authors</em> as the vilest of the human kind, to
which they have little more pretension of
resemblance than what arises from their
exterior form.</p>

<p class='c010'>“In so vast a continent as that of Africa,
and in so great a variety of climates and
provinces, we might expect to find a proportionable
diversity among the inhabitants,
in regard to their qualifications of
body and mind; strength, agility, industry,
and dexterity, on the one hand;
ingenuity, learning, arts and sciences, on
the other. But on the contrary, a general
uniformity runs through all these various
regions of people; so that if any difference
be found, it is only in degrees of
the same qualities; and, what is more
strange, those of the worst kind; it being
a common known proverb, that all people
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>on the globe have some good as well as
ill qualities, except the Africans. Whatever
great personages this country might
anciently have produced, and concerning
whom we have no information, they are
now everywhere degenerated into a brutish,
ignorant, idle, crafty, bloody, thievish,
mistrustful, and superstitious people,
even in those states where we might expect
to find them more polished, humane,
docile, and industrious.”—“This brutality
somewhat diminishes when they are
imported young, after they become habituated
to clothing, and a regular discipline
of life; but many are never reclaimed,
and remain savages, in every sense of the
word, to their latest period. We find
them marked with the same bestial manners,
stupidity, and vices, which debase
their brethren on the continent, who seem
to be distinguished from the rest of mankind,
not in person only, but in possessing
in the abstract every species of inherent
turpitude that is to be found dispersed
at large among the rest of the
human creation, with scarce a single feature
to extenuate this shade of character,
differing in this particular from all other
men; for in other countries, the most
abandoned villain we ever heard of has
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>rarely, if ever, been known unportioned
with some one good quality at least in his
composition.”—“Among so great a number
of provinces on this extensive continent,
and among so many millions of people,
we have heard but of one or two insignificant
tribes, who comprehended any
thing of mechanic arts, or manufacture;
and even these, for the most part, are said
to perform their work in a very bungling
and slovenly manner, perhaps not much
better than an oran-outang might with a
little pains be brought to do.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Ludicrous as the opinion may seem, I
do not think that an oran-outang husband
would be any dishonour to a Hottentot
female.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Maize, palm-oil, and a little stinking
fish, make up the general bill of fare of
the prince and the slave.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“They esteem the ape species as scarcely
their inferiors in humanity.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Their hospitality is the result of self-love;
they entertain strangers only in
hopes of extracting some service or profit
from them.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>“Their corporeal sensations are generally
of the grossest frame,” &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c010'>Such is Mr. Long’s portrait of the negro
character; such was the state of contempt
into which the whole race had fallen, in the
estimation of those who had known them
chiefly in that condition of wretchedness and
degradation into which a long continued
course of slavery had depressed them. Can
any thing shew more clearly, with what strong
prejudices against the negro race, the minds
not only of low uneducated men, but of a
West Indian, whose authority is great, and
whose name stands high among his countrymen,
were some years ago at least infected:
consequently they prove with what spirit and
temper, even well-informed men, among the
colonists, entered on the consideration of
the various questions involved in the large
and complicated discussion concerning the
abolition of the Slave Trade.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The question of highly important practical tendencies.</div>

<p class='c010'>But the subject is of the very first importance
in another view; for it is a truth so
clear, that it would be a mere waste of time
to prove it in detail—that our estimate of the
intellectual and moral qualities, of the natural
and acquired tempers and feelings, and
habits, of any class of our fellow creatures,
will determine our judgment as to what is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>necessary to their happiness, and still more
as to the treatment they may reasonably
claim at our hands. Now it be remembered,
the author, whose account of the Africans
has been just laid before you, was the
very best informed of those on whose views
and feelings, respecting the Negroes, our opponents
would have had us entirely rely.
Must not the representations of such witnesses
against the Negroes be received with
large abatement, and ought we not to lend
ourselves to their suggestions with considerable
diffidence? What judgment would they
be likely to form of the consideration to which,
whether in Africa, on shipboard, or in the
West Indies, the negro Slaves were entitled?
By how scanty a measure would their comforts
be dispensed to them! And when, in answer
to our inquiries, we were assured that
in these several situations, their treatment
was <em>sufficiently</em> mild and humane, and that
<em>due</em> attention was paid to their wants and
feelings, might we not reasonably receive
these assurances with some reserve, on calling
to mind that they proceeded from persons
whose estimate of <em>sufficiency</em> was drawn
from their calculations of what was <em>due</em> to
the wants and feelings, the pleasures, and
pains of a being little above the brute creation;
not, of a Being of talents and passions,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>of anticipations and recollections, of social
and domestic feelings similar to our own?</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Slave Traders account of the Negro character.</div>

<p class='c010'>The account given by the witnesses produced
by the Slave Traders, of the natural
and moral qualities of the Negroes, was of the
same unfavourable kind, though considerably
less strong in its colouring. I should detain
you too long by stating it in detail. It may
suffice to mention, in general, that the Africans
were represented, in respect to civilization
and knowledge, as but very little advanced
beyond the rudest state of savage
life. The population was said to be thin,
their agriculture in the lowest state, their only
manufacture a species of coarse mat or cloth.
They very rarely used any beasts for draught
or burthen, they had no public roads; no
knowledge of letters, or apparent sense of
their value. But the account of their personal
qualities was still more melancholy;
because it was such as to leave but slender
hopes of their ever emerging out of this dark
and barbarous state. The most respectable
witnesses produced by the Slave Traders,
some of whom had resided among the Africans
many years, and on various parts of the
coast, declared, that their stupidity, and still
more their indolence, were so firmly rooted
in their nature, as to be absolutely invincible;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>and, what may perhaps be justly regarded as
indicative of the worst natural disposition,
that they were deficient in domestic and parental
affection.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Mr. Bryan Edwards’s account.</div>

<p class='c010'>Even Mr. Bryan Edwards, though in
common more liberal than other defenders of
the Slave Trade, gives in his History of the
West Indies a highly unfavourable account
of the African character. It ought, however,
in all fairness, to be urged in his defence,
that his judgment of the Negroes was
formed under circumstances highly disadvantageous
to them; being grounded on what
he had known and heard of them in our West
India colonies, where their natural character
must necessarily have derived a deep taint
from the depraving effects of a long continued
state of slavery. To this cause, indeed,
he himself very frankly ascribes most of the
bad qualities which he enumerates. After exhibiting
the different shades of character of
the Slaves brought from different parts of
Africa, he goes on to state, what may be
deemed the general properties of the Negro
race, and these are of the most debasing and
depraving kind. They are in general distrustful
and cowardly; falsehood is one of
the most prominent features in their character;
they are prone to theft; sullen, selfish,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>unrelenting; and while the softer virtues
are seldom found among them, they are so
sunk in dissoluteness and licentiousness, that
the attempt to introduce the ceremony of
marriage among them, would be impracticable
to any good purpose. One of the few pleasing
traits in their character is their high veneration
for old age.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Parke’s character of the Negroes.</div>

<p class='c010'>After this melancholy picture, it is a relief
to the humane mind, to peruse the accounts
of the intellectual and moral dispositions and
character of the Negroes, which have been
given by persons who have had far superior
means of information. The chief of them,
Mr. Parke, and Mr. Golberry, were also,
from their connections, unfriendly to the
abolition, and cannot therefore be supposed
to be tinctured with any of the prejudices
which may be presumed to bias the minds
of the avowed advocates of the negro race.
It would be a grateful task to lay before you
such copious extracts, as would give you a
full and minute enumeration of the particulars
of the negro character; but my extracts,
to do justice to the subject, would almost fill
a volume. I must therefore refer you to my
appendix for a brief specimen of them, and
content myself here with exhibiting the mere
outlines of the very different portrait which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>has been taken of the Negroes, after a more
familiar and extended survey of their tempers
and conduct.</p>

<p class='c010'>Mr. Parke represents the Africans of the
interior as naturally superior, both in their
intellectual and moral endowments, to almost
any other uncivilized nation. He speaks in
high terms of their powers of ingenuity and
invention, of their quickness and cheerfulness;
of the value which they set on the
learning within their reach, and the price at
which they are willing to acquire it for
themselves, or their children; of the skill
which they display in several arts and manufactures.
But the natural character of
the Africans rises in our estimation, when,
from considering their intellectual, we take a
fair survey of their moral qualities; of the
reverence for truth in which the children
are educated by their mothers, among the
Mandingoes, who, let it be observed, constitute
the bulk of the inhabitants in all the
vast districts of Africa visited by Mr. Parke;
of their almost universal benevolence, gentleness,
and hospitality; of their courage,
and, when they have any adequate motive to
prompt them to work, of their industry and
perseverance; of their parental and filial
tenderness, of their social and domestic affection,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>of the conjugal fidelity of the women,
combined with great cheerfulness and frankness;
of the extraordinary attachment of
the Negroes to their country and home; in
some cases, of their magnanimity, of which
two instances are given, scarcely inferior to
any thing which is recorded in Greek or
Roman story.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Golberry’s character of the Negroes.</div>

<p class='c010'>Mr. Golberry’s account of the negro character
is at least equally favourable. “The
Foulahs, he says, are intelligent and industrious,
fine, strong, brave men; but, from
their habitual commerce with the Moors,
they are become savage and cruel. The
Mandingoes are well informed, graceful,
and active, and, in their mercantile character,
clever and indefatigable.  The
Jaloffs are honest, hospitable, generous,
and faithful; their character mild, and
inclined to good order and civilization.”
Besides this account of particular nations,
he observes of the Negroes in general, that
they have both taste, ingenuity, and cleverness,
and may be reckoned among the most
favoured people of nature. They are, perhaps,
the most prolific of all the human
species, which is probably owing to the moderation
they in general observe, in their
habits, regimen, and pleasures. He bears,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>if possible, a still stronger testimony to the
benevolence, hospitality, frankness, and generosity
of the negro character. The mothers,
says he, are passionately fond of their
children, and these discover in return great
filial tenderness. The women are always
kind and attentive.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Mr. Winterbottom’s.</div>

<p class='c010'>Concerning Mr. Winterbottom’s account,
I will here only state, that it corresponds, in
the great essentials of character, with the
representations already given, though it be
perhaps scarcely so favourable to the negro
character.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The Hottentots vindicated.</div>

<p class='c010'>Even the poor calumniated Hottentots,
who were long regarded as among the lowest
in the scale of being, have at length found
respectable and able advocates. Among the
many good qualities which the Hottentot
possesses, there is one, says Mr. Barrow, of
which he is master in an eminent degree, a
rigid adherence to truth: he may be considered
also as exempt from stealing. Sir James
Craig, when he commanded at the Cape,
attempted to form an African corps, in defiance
of the most confident prediction of
the colonists, whose prejudices against the
Hottentot race were scarcely less strong than
those of Mr. Long himself. “We were told,”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>says Sir James, “that their propensity to
drunkenness was so great, we should never
be able to reduce them to order or discipline;
and that the habit of roving was
so rooted in their disposition, we must
expect the whole corps would desert, the
moment they had received their clothing.”
Both these charges were confuted by experience.
Sir James goes on to remark, “Never
were people more contented or more grateful
for the treatment they now receive. We
have upwards of three hundred, who have
been with us nine months. It is therefore
with the opportunity of knowing them well,
that I venture to pronounce them an intelligent
race of men. All who bear arms
exercise well, and understand, immediately
and perfectly, whatever they are taught to
perform. Many of them speak English
tolerably well. Of all the qualities that
can be ascribed to a Hottentot, it will little
be expected I should expatiate upon their
cleanliness; and yet it is certain, that at
this moment our Hottentot parade would
not suffer in a comparison with that of some
of our regular regiments. They are now
likewise cleanly in their persons; the practice
of smearing themselves with grease
being entirely left off. I have frequently
observed them washing themselves in a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>rivulet, where they could have in view no
other object but cleanliness.” The poor
Bosjesman Hottentots are also stated as a
docile, tractable people, of innocent manners,
and beyond expression grateful to their benefactors.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Character of Booshuana and Baroloo natives.</div>

<p class='c010'>Some later travellers from the Cape of Good
Hope, and in the service of Government, have
penetrated into the heart of Africa to a great
depth, but short of the region in which the
Slave Trade prevails, and the account which,
both from their own knowledge and from the
representations of others, they give of the
natives, is still of the same encouraging kind.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Character given of the Negroes by the Abolitionists witnesses.</div>

<p class='c010'>After these accounts, you will not be surprised
to hear, that the representations given
of the Africans by the naval officers, and the
men of science before alluded to, were highly
favourable. One witness spoke of the acuteness
of their perceptions; another, of the extent
of their memory; a third, of their genius
for commerce; others, of their good workmanship
in gold, iron, and leather; the peculiarly
excellent texture of their cloth, and
the beautiful and indelible tincture of their
dyes. It was acknowledged that they supplied
the ships with many articles of provision,
with wood, and water, and other necessaries.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>Some spoke in high terms of their
peaceable disposition; all of their cheerfulness
and eminent hospitality.</p>

<p class='c010'>I have been the more diffuse on this topic,
because, though our commercial connection,
with Africa be of so old a date, we have
scarcely, till of late years, had any authentic
account of the interior. In a region so vast,
there must be a great variety of nations, and
very different accounts may be adduced of
particular countries; accounts not always,
however, of a very authentic kind. But it is
highly encouraging, and it is more than
enough to rescue the African race from the
unjust and general stigma which has been
cast on it, to know, that later travellers who
have visited the interior, in parts widely
distant from each other, have made such
pleasing reports of the intelligence, tempers
and dispositions, habits, and manners of the
natives of this vast continent.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Yet Africa never was civilized.—Argument resulting from that fact considered.</div>

<p class='c010'>But, notwithstanding all which has been
here adduced in favour of the negro character,
I am aware that there exists, not uncommonly,
in the minds even of men of understanding
and candour, a strong prejudice
against the African Negroes, on the ground
of their never having advanced to any considerable
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>state of civilization and knowledge, in
any period of the world. Let me be permitted,
in the first place, to consider that position
more particularly. They were always, it is
alleged, to a considerable degree barbarous.
Still more, in the remotest times to which our
accounts extend, slavery, and even a Slave
Trade, have been found to prevail in Africa.
Hence a presumption arises, that her inhabitants
are incapable of civilization, and that
Africa cannot much complain of a practice
which has become so congenial to her,
and which seems to arise, not from European
avarice, or cruelty, but rather from the genius
and dispositions of her people, or from some
incorrigible vice in her system of laws, institutions,
and manners.</p>

<p class='c010'>That Africa, which contains nearly a third
of the habitable globe, should never at any
period have been reclaimed from a state of
comparative barbarism, is, indeed, on the
first view, a strange phenomenon. But without
stopping to comment on the precision of
that reasoning which, on this ground, should
argue that it is justifiable for the European
nations to make Africa the scene, and her
sons the objects of the Slave Trade, we may
confidently affirm, that a considerate review
of the history, origin, and progress of civilization
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>and the arts, in all ages and countries,
will not only explain the difficulty, but will
give us good grounds for believing, that, reasoning
from experience, the interior of Africa
is full as much civilized as any other race of
men would have been, if placed in the same
situation.</p>

<p class='c010'>How is it that civilization and the arts grow
up in any country? The reign of law and of
civil order must be first established. From
law, says a writer of acute discernment and
great historical research, from law arises security;
from security, curiosity; from curiosity,
knowledge. As property is accumulated,
industry is excited, a taste for new gratifications
is formed, comforts of all kinds multiply,
and the arts and sciences naturally spring up
and flourish in a soil and climate thus prepared
for their reception. Yet, even under
these circumstances, the progress of the arts
and sciences would probably be extremely
slow, if a nation were not to import the improvements
of former times and other countries.
And we are well warranted, by the
experience of all ages, in laying it down as
an incontrovertible position—that the arts
and sciences, knowledge, and civilization, have
never yet been found to be the native growth
of any country; but that they have ever been
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>communicated from one nation to another,
from the more to the less civilized. Now,
whence was Africa to receive these valuable
presents?</p>

<p class='c010'>Let us summarily and briefly trace the
actual progress of human civilization from the
very earliest times. We learn from the Holy
Scriptures, and the researches of the ablest
antiquaries strongly confirm the supposition,
that Mesopotamia was the original seat of the
human race. We know not to what extent the
globe had been civilized before the Flood; but
the single family which survived that event,
inhabited the same or an adjacent part of
Asia. About a century afterwards, happened
the dispersion of nations, and confusion of
tongues; when different races of men, like
streams from one common fountain, diverged
in various directions to people the whole earth.
Without going into minute, and therefore
difficult, inquiries, we know that Assyria and
Egypt were the first nations which attained
to any great heights of social improvement.
Babylon, the capital of Assyria, was built
about 150 years after the flood, and the
Assyrian empire is supposed to have soon
after risen to a high degree of splendour.
The neighbouring province of Egypt, from
the mildness of its climate, and its singular
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>fertility, naturally attracted inhabitants, who,
of course, brought along with them the arts
of their native land. It is represented by the
Mosaic writings to have been, about 450
years after the flood, a flourishing and well
regulated kingdom; and all history testifies
that it was one of the earliest seats of the
arts and sciences.</p>

<p class='c010'>Next to these come the Phœnicians, a colony
from Egypt, situated on the coasts
of Syria, whose advances towards refinement
appear to have been great, and commercial
opulence considerable. They gradually made
settlements in the islands and on the shores
of the Mediterranean. By them, the first
rudiments of civilization, above all, the art
of alphabetical writing, were conveyed to
Greece, the various inhabitants of which
were then in a far ruder state than most
of the African nations in the present day.
They are said to have been cannibals, and
to have been ignorant even of the use of
fire. Indeed, their barbarous state, had it
not been proved by positive testimony, might
have been almost inferred, from the single
circumstance, of their assigning divine honours
to him who reclaimed them from living on
acorns and other spontaneous fruits of the
earth, and taught them to cultivate the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>ground for corn. Greece, as is justly observed
by Mr. Hume, was in a situation the most
favourable of all others to improvements of
every kind, especially in the arts and sciences.
It was divided into a number of little independent
communities, connected by commerce
and policy, and exciting each other by
mutual competition to those heights of excellence
to which they at length attained, and
which, in the arts of painting, sculpture, architecture,
poetry, and oratory, have perhaps
never since been reached by any other nation.
About 150 years before Christ, Greece was
subdued by the Romans, who thence derived
their civilization and knowledge. By the
extension of the Roman arms over almost the
whole of Europe, the seeds of civilization were
first sown in our northern regions, till then
immersed in darkness and barbarism; and
they sprung up and flourished during the
order and security which, previous to the irruption
of the northern swarms, prevailed for
some centuries throughout the Roman empire.
Such was the state of Europe.</p>

<p class='c010'>In Asia also, the progress of the Roman
arms was considerable, and their empire extensive:
there were, besides, other great and
populous nations, which, from their connection
with the earliest seats of civilization, had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>attained to various degrees of social refinement.
But of Africa, those parts alone which
border on the Mediterranean Sea had been
settled by colonies from any civilized nation.
This will not appear extraordinary, if we consider
the geographical circumstances of that
quarter of the globe, and, still more, the low
state of navigation among the ancients. Their
knowledge of navigation was so imperfect,
that they scarcely ever ventured out of sight
of land; and the account of the Phœnicians
having penetrated into the ocean, and having
found a way into the East Indies by the Cape
of Good Hope, although there now seems
reason to believe its truth, was in general
regarded as bearing on it’s very face it’s own
contradiction. The Romans had therefore
no access by the ocean to the interior of
Africa; and it was separated from the provinces
bordering on the Mediterranean by
an immense sea of sandy desert, near nine
hundred miles from north to south, and twice
that extent from east to west, beyond which,
though a few adventurous parties might venture
to penetrate, there was nothing of the
established regularity and order of a Roman
province. The very tales which were told
of the inhabitants of these districts, sufficiently
denote the imperfect acquaintance and
limited intercourse which subsisted with them.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>Hitherto, then, how or whence was civilization
to find its way into the interior of
Africa?</p>

<p class='c010'>Next, the Northern nations, who, seeking
for a more genial climate and a more fertile
soil, in the finest provinces of both the
eastern and western empire, overran the
civilized world in the fifth century after
Christ, were under no temptations to extend
their settlements beyond those natural barriers
which had formed the boundaries of
the Roman conquests. While the coasts of
the Mediterranean therefore were throughout
ravaged and colonized, the interior of
Africa was still neglected.</p>

<p class='c010'>At length the all-conquering followers of
Mahomet issued forth, and, after desolating
the fine African provinces which were subject
to Rome, some of their adventurous bands
seem to have penetrated in various quarters
into the interior, and, occupying the
banks of one of the finest rivers, to have
planted themselves, in greater or less numbers,
beyond the immense desert which
forms the northern boundary of interior
Africa. But it should be remembered, that
while the Mahometans, who overran the
various provinces of both the eastern and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>western empires, became civilized by the
nations they subdued, as Rome had been
before by her conquest of Greece, so that
they soon attained to a great degree of
knowledge and refinement; the tribes which
planted themselves in Africa, finding only
nations as illiterate and as unpolished as
themselves, retained all their original barbarism;
while their ferocious tempers and
habits, and their intolerant tenets, led them
to keep down their negro subjects in a state
of grievous subjection, and prevented that
secure enjoyment of person and property
which prompts men to industry, by securing
to them the enjoyment and use of what
they have acquired, and is indispensably
necessary for enabling the mind to exercise
its powers with freedom. Here, perhaps
however, the first faint beams of knowledge
and civilization shot into the darkness of
the negro nations; and it is remarkable,
that, barbarous as were the first Mahometan
settlers of interior Africa, and hostile to all
improvement as is the genius of Mahometanism,
yet such is the effect of any regular
government, that in those districts in which
the Mahometans either possess the entire government,
or a very considerable influence over
it, there were many centuries ago great and
populous cities, provinces not ill cultivated,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>and a considerable degree of social order
and civilization.</p>

<p class='c010'>It may therefore be boldly affirmed, that
the interior, to which may be added the
western coast of Africa to the south of the
great desert, never enjoyed any of that intercourse
with more polished nations, without
which no nation on earth is known ever
to have attained to any high degree of civilization;
and that, contemptuously as we
and the other civilized nations of Europe now
speak of the Africans, had we been left in their
situation, we should probably have been not
more civilized than themselves.</p>

<p class='c010'>Let the case be put, that the interior of
Africa had been made by the Almighty the
cradle of the world—that issuing thence, instead
of from the north-western part of Asia,
the several streams of nations had pervaded
and settled the whole of that extensive continent—that
the banks of the Niger, not less
fertile than those of the Euphrates or the
Nile, had been the seat of the first great
empire—that the kingdoms of Tombuctoo
and Houssa had been the Assyria and Egypt
of Africa, and that the arts and sciences had
been communicated to a cluster of little independent
states, and, under the same favourable
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>circumstances, had been carried to the
same heights of excellence as that which they
attained in European Greece—that these had
been however in their turn swallowed up,
together with the whole of that vast continent,
by the arms of a single nation, the Romans
of Africa, under the shelter of whose established
dominion the various nations throughout
that spacious extent, enjoying the blessings
of civil order and security, the natural
consequence had followed, that in every quarter
the arts and sciences had sprung up and
flourished—Might not our northern countries
have been then in the same state of comparative
barbarism in which Africa now lies?
Might not some African philosopher, proud of
his superior accomplishments, have made it a
question, whether those wretched whites, the
very outcasts of nature, who were banished
to the cold regions of the north, were capable
of civilization? And thus, might not a Slave
Trade in Europeans, aye, in Britons, have
then been justified by those sable reasoners,
on precisely the same grounds as those on
which the African Slave Trade is now supported?</p>

<p class='c010'>However the last supposition may mortify
our pride, it will appear less monstrous
to those who recollect, that not only in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>ancient times the wisest among the Greeks
considered the barbarians, including all the
inhabitants of our quarter of the earth, as
expressly intended by nature to be their
slaves; not only that the Romans regularly
sold into slavery all the captives whom they
took in the wars, by which on all sides they
gradually extended their empire till it was
almost commensurate with the then known
world; but that our own island long furnished
it’s share towards the supply of the Roman
market. Even at a later period of our history,
we Englishmen have been the subjects of a
Slave Trade, for which it is remarkable that
the city of Bristol<a id='r11' /><a href='#f11' class='c011'><sup>[11]</sup></a> was the grand emporium.
That ancient city has now, I trust for the last
time, retired from that guilty commerce.</p>

<p class='c010'>In fact we know from history, that the great
principle, of the demand producing the supply,
has been amply verified in this instance, and
that when countries in which slavery has been
tolerated, have been sufficiently affluent to
purchase Slaves, the Slaves have been caught
and brought, like other wild animals, from
the less civilized regions of the earth, where
the inhabitants were less secure against foreign
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>invaders, or against internal violence.
Had not our island therefore been conquered
by the Romans, who lodged in the soil the
seeds of civilization which sprung up afterwards,
when circumstances favoured their
growth; and had the neighbouring provinces
on the continent, from which otherwise the
rays of knowledge might have enlightened us,
remained also unsubdued; what reason is
there to suppose that we, any more than the
inhabitants of any other savage country,
should now be a civilized nation? than, for
instance, the whole continent of America before
it was settled by Europeans? than the
islands in the Pacific Ocean to this day?</p>

<p class='c010'>But it may be even affirmed, that the Africans,
without the advantages to be derived
from an intercourse with polished nations,
have made greater advancements towards
civilization than perhaps any other uncivilized
people on earth. Nor is this the state of those
nations only, which, from their having received
some tincture of the Mussulman tenets, may
be supposed to have owed their improvement
to their Mahometan invaders, but in a considerable
degree in those countries also where
there are no traces whatever of any such connection.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>Let us appeal to experience. In what
state was Britain herself, when first visited
by the Romans? More barbarous than many
of the African kingdoms in the present day.
Look to the aboriginal inhabitants of both
the northern and southern continents of the
new world, both when America was first discovered,
and at the present day, with the exception,
perhaps, of only the kingdom of
Mexico. Look to New Holland, a tract of
country as great as all Europe; look to Madagascar,
to Borneo, to Sumatra, to the other
islands in the Indian seas, or to those of the
Pacific Ocean. Are not the Africans far more
civilized than any of these? The fact is undeniable.
Instead of a miserable race of wretched
savages, thinly scattered over countries of immense
extent; destitute almost of every art
and manufacture (this is the condition of the
greater part of the nations above specified),
we find the Africans, in the interior, in the
state of society which has been found, from
history, next to precede the full enjoyment
of all civil and social blessings; the inhabitants
of cities and of the country mutually
contributing towards each others’ support;
political and civil rights recognized both by
law and practice; natural advantages discerned,
and turned to account; both agriculture,
and, still more, manufactures, carried to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>a tolerable state of improvement; the population
in some countries very considerable; and
a strong sense of the value of knowledge, and
an earnest desire of obtaining it. How great
is the progress which the Africans have made
compared with the scanty advantages they
could derive from their barbarous Mahometan
invaders!</p>

<p class='c010'>But it has been the peculiar misery of
Africa, that nations, already the most civilized,
finding her in the state which has been described,
instead of producing any such effects
as might be hoped for from a commercial connection
between a less and a more civilized
people; instead of imparting to the former
the superior knowledge and improvements of
the latter; instead of awakening the dormant
powers of the human mind, of calling forth
new exertions of industry, and thus leading
to a constant progression of new wants, desires,
and tastes; to the acquisition of property,
to the acquisition of capital, to the
multiplication of comforts, and, by the more
firm establishment of law and order, to that
security and quiet, in which knowledge and
the arts naturally grow up and flourish: instead
of all these effects; it has been the sad
fate of Africa, that when she did enter into
an intercourse with polished nations, it was
an intercourse of such a nature, as, instead of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>polishing and improving, has tended not
merely to retard her natural progress, but to
deprave and darken, and, if such a new term
might be used where unhappily the novelty
of the occurrence compels us to resort to one,
to barbarize her wretched inhabitants.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>New phenomenon: interior of Africa more civilized than the coast.</div>

<p class='c010'>And now we are prepared both to admit
and to understand a fact, which, though
found to take place universally in Africa, is
contrary to all former experience. In reviewing
the moral history of man, and contemplating
his progress from ignorance and
barbarism, to the knowledge and comforts
of a state of social refinement, it has been
almost invariably found, that the sea coasts
and the banks of navigable rivers, those
districts which from their situation had most
intercourse with more polished nations, have
been the earliest civilized. In them, civil
order, and social improvement, agriculture,
industry, and at length the arts and sciences,
have first flourished, and they have by degrees
extended themselves into more inland
regions. But the very reverse is the case in
Africa. There, the countries on the coast
are in a state of utter ignorance and barbarism,
which also are always found to be
the greatest where the intercourse with the
Europeans has been the longest and most
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>intimate;—while the interior countries,
where not the face of a white man was ever
seen, are far more advanced in the comforts
and improvements of social life.</p>

<p class='c010'>This is so extraordinary a phenomenon,
and it points out so clearly the pernicious
effects of the Slave Trade on the prosperity
of Africa, that it deserves the most serious
attention. However extraordinary the statement
may appear, it is confirmed by the unvarying
testimony of all African travellers.
Such is the result of the experience of Mr.
Parke, who penetrated deep into Africa in one
part; such is that of Mr. Winterbottom, who
travelled about 200 miles inland in another:
and the same extraordinary fact has since
received a most striking confirmation, in the
accounts, before recited, of the Booshuana
and Baroloo nations.</p>

<p class='c010'>Surely more than enough has been stated,
to shew how far the present state of Africa
is from furnishing any just grounds for believing
that the Africans are incapable of
civilization. Our only cause for wonder is,
not that on the coast, where all is anarchy
and insecurity, the inhabitants should have
gradually declined from the state of civilization
to which they had attained, and should
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>have at length sunk into a state of profound
ignorance and barbarism; for they have long
been in circumstances which have been ever
found utterly incompatible with the rise and
progress of civilization and knowledge; the
more just subject of astonishment is, that
the kingdoms in the interior should still be
found in a condition of so much civil order
and improvement, in spite of the pernicious
effects of the Slave Trade on their moral and
social state. But, through the gracious ordination
of Heaven, the political, like the
natural body, can exist under severe and
harassing disorders. They may materially
injure its health and comfort, and yet not
utterly destroy it. Thus the evils which the
interior countries suffer from the Slave Trade,
are great and many; but their effects are
not, as they commonly are on the coast, such
as to break up the very foundations of society,
and destroy the cohesion of its elementary
parts. In the interior, the Slave
Trade exercises powers of destruction which
justly entitle it to the character of one of
the greatest scourges of the human race.
But it is on the coast that it reaches its full
dimensions, and attains to the highest point
of its detestable pre-eminence.</p>

<p class='c010'>But if the foregoing remarks prove plainly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>that our Slave dealers have no just grounds
for arguing, from the present uncivilized state
of the coast, that it is incapable of civilization;
surely we cannot but be astonished at
the finished assurance, as well as the consummate
injustice and cruelty, with which
they would charge on the natural constitution
and character of the natives of Africa,
that very barbarism of which they themselves
are the authors; and not only so, but which,
after having produced it, they urge on us as
a plea for continuing that wretched land
under the same dreadful interdict, not only
from all the comforts of the civilized state,
but from all the charities of life; from all
virtue and all happiness; sealing her up for
ever in bondage, ignorance, and blood.</p>

<p class='c010'>You have been detained, I fear, far too
long before this melancholy picture; and yet
I am almost ashamed of apologizing for prolixity,
when I consider what “a world of
woes” it is which I have been exhibiting to
your view.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Slave Traders’ argument that the Negroes were at home in a worse state of slavery.</div>

<p class='c010'>When men began to question the soundness
of that logic, which grounded the right
to carry off the natives of Africa into slavery,
on their state of barbarism and ignorance;
and still more, when it was retorted, that,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>even granting the premises, that the Africans
were thus dark and savage; the conclusion of
a Christian reasoner ought naturally to be,
that it was the duty of more favoured nations
to civilize and enlighten, not to oppress and
enslave, them; another set of arguments
was brought forth; that two-thirds, or perhaps
three-fourths, of the Africans were
Slaves in their own country; and not only
so, but that partly from the cruel and bloody
superstitions, partly from the political despotism
common in Africa, their state was so
wretched at home, (the very worst West
Indian slavery, as Mr. Edwards affirms, being
infinitely preferable to the very best in
Africa) that, independently on any motives
of interest, humanity alone would prompt us
to transport them from such a condition of
misery and degradation, to the comparative
Paradise of West Indian servitude. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>The assertion answered and refuted.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
To all
this the reply was obvious, that we had no
right to make men happy against their will;
and that whatever effect such an argument
might have had on us, if urged from African
lips, yet that it came before us in a very
suspicious shape, when proceeding from those
of a West Indian. But since all the above
allegations, however unsatisfactory on grounds
of justice, must be acknowledged, to have
some place in determining the practical
<span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>effect of the Slave Trade, on the happiness
of the Africans themselves; it may not be
improper to observe, that these assertions
also are utterly disproved by Mr. Parke, and
by other recent travellers, no less than by
the witnesses produced by the Abolitionists.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>African Slaves real state.</div>

<p class='c010'>The slavery of Africa appeared, in truth, to
be a species of feudal or rather of patriarchal
vassalage. The Slaves could not be sold by
their masters but for crimes; not without
the form of a trial, nor, in several parts, even
without the verdict of a jury. They were
described as sitting with their masters, like
members of the same family, in primitive
simplicity and comfort. “In all the laborious
occupations which Mr. Parke describes, both
agricultural and manufacturing, the Master
and the Slave work together without any
distinction of superiority.” It appears also,
from a passage in Parke, that Master and
Slave stand towards each other in a parental
and filial relation: “Have I not served
you—” said an African, who had served
Parke in the capacity of a domestic Slave,
“Have I not served you as if you had been
to me a father and a master?” Indeed it
was the more ill-advised to make any comparison
between the slavery of Africa and of
the West Indies, because even the witnesses of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>our opponents give much the same account of
the condition of the African Slaves.</p>

<p class='c010'>These remarks ought ever to be borne in
mind in all our considerations and reasonings
concerning the state of society in Africa.
They are sometimes, however, forgotten by
the very writers themselves by whom they
have been made. Our opponents have
availed themselves of the ambiguities of
language; and the state of these domestic
Slaves, who are styled the bulk of the African
population, is spoken of in terms applicable
only to the condition of those wretched
beings who are destined for the Slave market,
and who are waiting in fetters for a purchaser.
The existence of this milder species
of vassalage may even facilitate the complete
civilization of the negro nations, by having
familiarized their minds to the gradations of
rank, and by having accustomed them to
submit to the restraints of social life, and to
be controlled by the authority of law and
custom.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Opponents argument from the cruelty of the African despots, and particularly from those of the King of Dahomy.</div>

<p class='c010'>Much use was likewise attempted to be
made of the cruelties of some of the African
monarchs, and especially of a certain king
of Dahomy. “It was mercy to the poor
Negroes to rescue them from such barbarities.”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>But the argument was only a proof
of the wretched straits to which our opponents
must be reduced, when they called in
the aid of such an auxiliary. Yet was this
argument urged with a grave face by men
of education and intelligence; and it may
therefore deserve a serious, though a brief
answer. It is probably true that the kingdom
of Dahomy had the misfortune to be
governed by a cruel tyrant. His invasion
of the neighbouring kingdom of Whidah, was
attended with a dreadful slaughter; and it
may be fact, that, like a celebrated oriental
conqueror, Nadir Shah, he thatched his palace
with the heads of his prisoners. His
cruelties, and still more those of the Dahoman
monarchs in general, must however
have been excessively exaggerated, since
Mr. Devaynes, whose personal knowledge of
Dahomy was greater than that of any other
person, and who, though not favourably inclined
to our cause, delivered his evidence
with great frankness and candour, declared
that the Dahomans were a very happy people.
But, not to insist on the unfairness of attempting
to justify the Slave Trade in general,
by the cruelties said to be practised in
one particular district, which constitutes not
perhaps a fiftieth part of the region from
which the Slaves are supplied; not to urge,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>moreover, that, but for the Slave Trade, this
whole system of superstition would probably
have been ere now at an end; the cruelties
of the Dahoman court are the effect of the
native superstitions, and it therefore seems
very doubtful, whether or not the Slave
Trade lessens the number of the victims: while,
as the very witness, who dwelt most strongly
on this argument, himself allowed; it leaves
their place, by having taken off the convicts
who would otherwise have been sacrificed, to
be supplied by innocent individuals. But,
what will you say, when you hear that, as
Atkins<a id='r12' /><a href='#f12' class='c011'><sup>[12]</sup></a> informs us, the cruelties practised
in the invasion of Whidah were committed
by him in a war undertaken with a view of
punishing the adjacent nation, for having
stolen away some of his subjects, for the
purpose of selling them for Slaves? Thus, it
appears, that to the Slave Trade itself is
fairly to be imputed this greatest of all
recorded instances of the cruelties of an
African warfare, that very instance on which
our opponents have relied.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The Slaves brought to the coast for sale would be massacred in case of abolition.</div>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>But an argument for the continuance of
the Slave Trade has been grounded on the
massacre, which would otherwise take place,
of the Slaves which had been brought down
to the coast for sale. This slaughter, however,
even granting it to be well founded,
ought, in all fairness, to be charged to the
account of the Slave Trade, which had created
the demand for these wretched victims.
At any rate it would only happen once; for
the Slave hunters would cease to catch and
bring down for sale this species of game, when
it was known there could no longer be any
demand for it. But in truth, as the supposition
is utterly contrary to common sense,
so it is abundantly contradicted by experience;
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>The assertion positively contradicted by opponents partisans.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
for it clearly appears from Mr. Parke,
as well as from the testimony of other witnesses,
that Slaves, when brought down to the
coast for sale, are set to work for their own
maintenance, or for their master’s emolument,
either when there is no demand for them, or
when the price offered for them is deemed
inadequate to their value. It further appears
that, even at this time, “It sometimes happens,
when no ships are on the coast, that
a humane and considerate master incorporates
his purchased Slaves among his domestics;
and their offspring, at least, if not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>the parents, become entitled to all the privileges
of the native class.”<a id='r13' /><a href='#f13' class='c011'><sup>[13]</sup></a></p>

<div class='sidenote'>Middle passage.</div>

<p class='c010'>On the middle passage but little shall be
said; but we must not pass from Africa to
the West Indies, without some few observations.</p>

<p class='c010'>When the public attention was first called
to this branch of the subject, it was alleged,
and with considerable plausibility, that self-interest
alone would be a sufficient security
against abuses; for not only was the owner of
the Slave ship interested in having the Slaves
brought to the port of sale in the best possible
condition; but the master, officers, and surgeons
of the ships had all a similar interest,
their profits being made to depend, in a considerable
degree, on the average value of the
cargo. To this argument from self-interest,
it must be confessed, that more weight was
justly due in this part of the case, than in
any other; because the interest was nearer,
and more direct, and was not counteracted
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>by any interest of an opposite nature; yet
even here it was proved but too decisively,
that, as in other cases, nature was too hard
for reason, the passions too powerful for interest.
The habit of viewing, and treating
these wretched beings as mere articles of merchandize,
had so blinded the judgment, and
hardened the heart, as to produce a course
of treatment highly injurious to the interest
of the owners and officers of Slave ships, and
at the same time abounding in almost every
circumstance that could aggravate the miseries
of the Slaves. When the condition therefore
and treatment of the Negroes on shipboard
were first laid open, the indignation
of the House of Commons was excited so
strongly, that though the Session of Parliament
had nearly closed, a Bill was immediately
brought in and passed, with a view to
mitigate their sufferings, during even the short
period for which, it was then conceived, the
existence of the Slave Trade could be tolerated.
Human ingenuity had almost been
exhausted in contriving expedients for crowding
the greatest possible number of bodies
into a given space; and when the smallpox,
the flux, or any other epidemic, broke
out among them, the scene was horrible beyond
description. Even where there was no
such peculiar aggravation, the sufferings of the
poor wretches were such as exhausted all
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>powers of description. Accordingly, the
average mortality on board the Slave ships
was very considerable. Often, during a voyage
of a few weeks, so many perished, that
if in any country the same rate of mortality
should prevail, the whole population would
be swept away in a single year. The survivors
also were landed in such a diseased
state, that four and a half per cent. of the
whole number imported were estimated to die
in the short interval between the arrival of the
ship and the sale of the cargo, probably not
more than a fortnight; and, after the Slaves
had passed into the hands of the planters, the
numbers which perished from the effects of
the voyage were allowed to be very considerable<a id='r14' /><a href='#f14' class='c011'><sup>[14]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c010'>A Bill for mitigating these evils was proposed
by that justly respected member of
the House of Commons, Sir William Dolben,
and, after great opposition, was passed into a
law. That law has since been from time to time
renewed and amended, prescribing certain
conditions and regulations, with a view to the
health and comfort of the Slaves. For want of
some effectual means of enforcing this law,
many of its provisions have not, it is supposed,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>been carried into strict execution. Still its
primary object has been attained, and the
evils, arising from crowding great numbers
into too small a space, have been considerably
mitigated. Much good has likewise
been done by turning the attention of the
Slave dealers to the subject, and by convincing
them that parsimony is not always
œconomy.</p>

<p class='c010'>But many of the sufferings of these
wretched beings are of a sort, for which
no legislative regulations can provide a remedy.
Several of them, indeed, arise necessarily
out of their peculiar circumstances, as
connected with their condition on shipboard.
It is necessary to the safety of the vessel, to secure
the men by chains and fetters. It is necessary
to confine them below during the night,
and, in very stormy weather, during the day
also. Often it happens that, even with the
numbers still allowed to be taken, especially
when some of those epidemic diseases prevail,
which, though less frequent than formerly,
will yet occasionally happen; and
when men of different countries and languages,
or of opposite tempers, are linked
together; such scenes of misery take place
as are too nauseous for description.<a id='r15' /><a href='#f15' class='c011'><sup>[15]</sup></a> Still,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>in rough weather, their limbs must often be
excoriated by lying on the boards; still they
will often be wounded by the fetters:<a id='r16' /><a href='#f16' class='c011'><sup>[16]</sup></a> still
food and exercise will be deemed necessary
to present the animal in good condition at
the place of sale: still some of them will
loath their food, and be averse to exercise,
from the joint effect perhaps of sea-sickness
and mental uneasiness; and still while in
this state they will probably be charged
with sulkiness; and eating, and dancing in
their fetters will be enforced by stripes:
still the high netting will be necessary, that
standing precaution of an African ship
against acts of suicide: but, more than all,
still must the diseases of the mind remain
entire, nay, they may perhaps increase in
force, from the attention being less called off by
the urgency of bodily suffering; the anguish
of husbands torn from their wives, wives
from their husbands, and parents from their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>children; the pangs arising from the consideration,
that they are separated for ever
from their country, their friends, their relatives,
and connections, remain the same. In
short, they have the same painful recollection
of the past, and the same dreadful forebodings
of the future; while they are still among
strangers, whose appearance, language, and
manners are new to them, and every surrounding
object is such as must naturally inspire
terror. In short, till we can legislate
for the mind; till by an Act of Parliament we
can regulate the affections of the heart, or,
rather, till we can extinguish the feelings of
nature; till we can completely unman and
brutalize these wretched beings, in order to
qualify them for being treated like brutes;
the sufferings of the Slaves, during the middle
passage, must still remain extreme. The
stings of a wounded conscience man cannot
inflict; but nearly all which man can do to
make his fellow creatures miserable, without
defeating his purpose by putting a speedy
end to their existence, will still be here
effected; and it will still continue true, that
never can so much misery be found condensed
into so small a space, as in a Slave ship during
the middle passage.</p>

<p class='c010'>But this part of the subject should not
be quitted without the mention of one circumstance,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>which justly leads to a very
important inference as to other parts of the
case. When Parliament entered into the
investigation of the situation and treatment
of the Slaves, during the middle passage;
notwithstanding the decisive proofs, adduced,
and fatally confirmed by the dreadful mortality,
of the miseries which the Slaves endured
on shipboard, the Slave Traders themselves
gave a directly opposite account; maintained
that the Slaves were even luxuriously
accommodated, and, above all, that they had
abundant room, even when there was not
near space sufficient for them to lie on their
backs.<a id='r17' /><a href='#f17' class='c011'><sup>[17]</sup></a> They added likewise, that at that
very period the trade hung by a thread, and
that the proposed limitation as to numbers,
if carried into a law, would infallibly and
utterly ruin it. The agent for the West
Indies joined in their opposition, and predicted
the mischief which would follow. The
limitation was adopted; and scarcely had a
year elapsed, before we heard from the West
Indies, from the Assembly of Jamaica itself,
of the benefits which the measure was likely
to produce, on account of the gross abuses
which had before notoriously prevailed, fatal
alike to the health of the Slaves and the interest
of the planters. Many years have now
elapsed, and it is at length universally acknowledged,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>that the measure has eminently
contributed to the interest of every one of
the parties concerned.<a id='r18' /><a href='#f18' class='c011'><sup>[18]</sup></a> May we not infer,
that probably, in other parts of this question,
the parties do not always judge very accurately
with respect to their real interests; and
that the prospect of immediate advantage
may cause them to be insensible to a greater
but more distant benefit.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Grand allegation of West Indians, that the stock of Slaves cannot be kept up without importations.</div>

<p class='c010'>But against all, which justice and humanity
could bring forward against the Slave Trade,
it was still to be urged, that the continuance
of it was necessary to the existence of our
West Indian colonies. To put the argument
in more specific form, it was objected, that
the stock of Slaves then actually in the West
Indies could not be maintained by natural
generation, without being recruited from time
to time by importations from Africa, and
therefore, that the abolition of the Slave Trade
would produce the sure, though gradual, ruin
of our colonies, with all those effects on the
wealth and strength of the mother country
which must follow from the loss of so valuable
a member of the empire.</p>

<p class='c010'>To the examination of this objection, let
me intreat your most serious attention; for
on it, in fact, the whole argument turns, so
far as policy is in question. For my own
<span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>part I hesitate not to say, that, let the apparent
temptation of profit be what it may,
it never can be the real interest of any nation
to be unjust and inhuman; to suppose the
contrary, would be almost to arraign the
wisdom and goodness of the Almighty, as it
would undoubtedly be, to admit a principle
directly at war with his revealed will. Nor
can I forbear taking occasion to congratulate
my country, that in the discussions on this
subject, the greatest of her statesmen, both
dead and living, even those who have differed
almost on every other question, have declared
their concurrent assent to that grand and
aweful truth, <em>that the principles of justice are
immutable in their nature, and universal in
their application; the duty at once, and the
interest, of nations, no less than of individuals</em>.</p>

<p class='c010'>Fully impressed with the force of these
sentiments, I could not believe that the prosperity
of the West Indies must necessarily be
built on a foundation of injustice and cruelty;
neither could I understand why, in the West
Indies alone, the Negroes could not even
keep up their numbers. The contrary supposition
is in truth refuted, not only by its
being a contradiction of the great Law of
Nature, but by its being contrary to the universal
experience of all other countries. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Presumptive arguments to the contrary, furnished by experience.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
For
elsewhere, even under the most unfavourable
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>circumstances, not merely the human species,
but specifically the Negro race, had been
found to increase; indeed Negroes were said to
be by nature peculiarly prolific. The climate
of the West Indies is similar to that of Africa.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>In Africa<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
Why then should the same race of beings
gradually diminish in the former country,
which in the latter have so increased and
multiplied, as for two centuries to bear the
continual drain of their population to the opposite
side of the Atlantic. On examining
whether in fact the negro race has kept up
its numbers in other foreign countries, we
find that it has increased, and sometimes
rapidly, even where the influence of the climate
might be justly supposed to be highly
unfavourable.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>In the United States of America, Negro Slaves increase.</div>

<p class='c010'>The climate of the United States of America
is far from being well suited to the negro constitution,
which, we are assured, is so little
patient of cold, as even in the West Indies
to suffer from it<a id='r19' /><a href='#f19' class='c011'><sup>[19]</sup></a>. The cold in America is
often very severe in the winter, even in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>the southern states; and the peculiar nature
of the employment of great numbers of
the Slaves who work on the rice plantations,
must operate very unfavourably on their
health; yet the Negro Slaves are universally
acknowledged to have so rapidly increased in
that country, that, according to the last
census of the American population, without
taking into the account any importations, the
Negroes had increased so much in the ten
years last preceding the augmentation, that,
advancing at the same rate, their numbers
would be doubled in about twenty-four years.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Slaves increase, in Bencoolen.</div>

<p class='c010'>Again, in Bencoolen, which has been accounted
one of the most unhealthy climates
on earth, the Negro Slaves had increased<a id='r20' /><a href='#f20' class='c011'><sup>[20]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c010'>But, lest the decrease in our Islands should
be supposed to arise out of some peculiarity
of the West Indian climate, <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Slaves
increase,
in the West
Indies
themselves.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
even in the West
Indies themselves undoubted instances of
negro increase can be adduced. The crew
of a Slave ship had been wrecked on the
unsettled island of St. Vincents, about the
beginning of the 18th century. They had
every difficulty to contend with, were wholly
unprovided with necessaries, and were obliged
to maintain a constant war with the native
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>Charaibs; yet they had soon multiplied exceedingly.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The Maroons increase.</div>

<p class='c010'>Even in the island of Jamaica itself, the
Maroons, the descendants of the Negro
Slaves, who, when the island was originally
captured, made their escape into the
mountains, and ever afterwards lived the
life of savages; the Maroons, who were acknowledged
by the West Indians themselves
to be, under peculiar circumstances, so unfavourable
to the maintenance of their numbers,
that their decrease would furnish no
fair argument for the general impossibility
of keeping up the stock, were found by
actual enumeration to have nearly doubled
their numbers in the period between 1749
and 1782.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The Domestic Negroes increase.</div>

<div class='sidenote'>The Free Blacks and Mulattoes increase.</div>

<p class='c010'>In the same island of Jamaica, the domestic
Slaves were said by Long to increase rapidly.
The free Blacks and the Mulattoes, it was
allowed by Mr. Long, increased. Several
particular instances were adduced of gangs of
Slaves having been kept up, and even having
increased, without importations; and one of
the most eminent of the medical men in
Jamaica, who had under his care no less than
4,000 Negroes, stated, that there was a very
considerable increase of Negroes on the
properties of that island, particularly in the
parish in which he resided, one of the largest
<span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>in Jamaica. All these instances certainly
afforded a strong presumptive proof, that the
stock of Slaves in the islands might be kept
up, and might even increase without continual
importations.</p>

<p class='c010'>But the conclusion resulting from so much
and such diversified experience was established
also by positive and decisive proof.
The assertion, that the stock of Slaves actually
in the islands could not be maintained
without continual importations, received an
unanswerable refutation, especially from Mr.
Pitt, whose superior powers of reasoning, as
well as of eloquence, were never more powerfully
displayed than in the debate of that
memorable night when this subject was under
discussion, and whose positions were clearly
deduced from the very documents and accounts
which had been supplied by the
islands themselves.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Importance of the question, concerning the keeping up of the stock of Slaves without Importations.</div>

<p class='c010'>Here, undoubtedly, lies the main stress of
the case, so far as policy is concerned. On
the determination of this question must obviously
rest all the assertions which have
been so industriously circulated, and all the
apprehensions which have so generally prevailed,
that the immediate abolition would
prove ruinous to our West Indian Colonies.
Even in 1792, much less in the present day,
scarcely any man will deny, that if the stock
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>of Slaves can be kept up, the abolition will,
in various ways, be highly beneficial to the
islands.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Proof that Slave Trade not needed for maintaining the present stock of Slaves.</div>

<p class='c010'>It was proved then, first, That the abuses
and the obstructions to the natural increase,
which too generally prevail, were sufficient
to account for a rapidly decreasing population,
and even to lead us to expect it.</p>

<p class='c010'>Secondly, That the decrease, which really
was considerable a century ago, had been
gradually diminishing; till at length there
was good reason to believe it had entirely
ceased, and that the population fully maintains
itself.</p>

<p class='c010'>Thirdly, That, therefore, if the great and
numerous abuses which now prevail should
be materially mitigated, we might confidently
anticipate a great and rapid increase in
future.</p>

<p class='c010'>These three propositions being made out,
it follows of course, that the only substantial
objection to the abolition, on the grounds of
policy, is completely done away. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Proof of existing abuses unfavourable to increase.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
To the
proof, therefore, of these propositions respectively,
let me beg your most serious
attention. And now, in establishing the first
of them, it becomes my duty to point out
the various abuses of the colonial system, so
<span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>far as they have any natural tendency to keep
down the population below its proper level.
I am well aware that I am here about to
tread on very tender ground. I know that
it is imputed to the Abolitionists, that they
have endeavoured to excite an unjust clamour
against the Colonists by tales of cruelty,
which, if not utterly false, or, at least, grossly
exaggerated, were, however, individual and
rare instances. They have been represented
as the rule, it is said, not as the exception,
and as fixing a general stigma on all
colonial proprietors.</p>

<p class='c010'>That on a subject naturally calculated to
call forth powerfully the feelings of every
humane mind, zeal may have carried some of
our advocates too far, and made them not
sufficiently discriminate between particular
cases of ill-treatment, and the general system
of management, I will not deny. Yet I
might, perhaps, retort the accusation, and
object, in my turn, that our opponents have
not in general acknowledged even the particular
cases of cruelty, and joined with us
in reprobating them; but that the facts themselves
have been denied, as if it were really
the common cause of the Colonists, in which
all were to stand or fall together.</p>

<p class='c010'>Yet, surely, any one who considers how
great, even in men of rank and education,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>have ever been the abuses of absolute power;
who recollects, besides, that in the West
Indies, Slaves of inferior value are of very
low price, and consequently, that any man
who possesses a horse in this country might
possess a Slave in that, would be sure that
individual instances of cruelty must frequently
occur. Let any one who should be
inclined to pause on this position, consider
how that noble animal, the horse, is too often
treated in the face of day, in the very streets
of the capital of this civilized country. But
for myself I can truly declare, that I cannot
be justly charged with having insisted on
particular cases of West Indian cruelty. On
the contrary, I have uniformly abstained
from whatever could provoke or irritate the
Colonists, as far as was possibly consistent
with justice to the cause. I have sometimes
even doubted whether the cause may not
have suffered from my abstinence.</p>

<p class='c010'>But, in justice to my own character, let
me declare, that I have observed this line
of conduct, not merely from interested motives,
that our opponents might not be heated
into still stronger opposition, but from feelings
of a more generous nature. I have
borne in mind, that the present generation
of West Indian proprietors are not the first
settlers of the colonies, or the first maintainers
<span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>of the Slave Trade; excepting, however,
the formers of the new settlements,
which, alas! have been made to a prodigious
extent within the last sixteen years. The
older proprietors inherited their estates as
we in Britain inherited ours; and must we
not expect them to be naturally tinctured
with the prejudices arising out of their circumstances
and situations, since it is almost
as difficult to be exempted from the operation
of these in the moral world, as for natural
productions not to possess the peculiar qualities
and flavour of their climate and soil.</p>

<p class='c010'>But, speaking generally, for the absentees
I feel above all other proprietors; many of
them born and educated in the mother
country, and therefore possessing all the principles,
sympathies, and feelings which belong
to our state of society. They are most of
them ignorant of the real state of things in
the colonies; they naturally give credit to the
accounts which they receive from their agents
and correspondents. They often, I doubt
not, in some cases I know, they send over
orders to their managers to treat their Slaves
with the utmost humanity and liberality.
There are among them, men who consider
the Slaves whom they inherit, as a family of
unfortunate men, with whose protection and
comfort Providence has charged them, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>whose well-being they are therefore bound,
by the highest obligations, to promote.</p>

<p class='c010'>Far therefore be it from me to throw out
a general reproach against the whole West
Indian body. In this case indeed, as in
others of a similar nature, the more the general
mass is liable to any taint, the more
to be found exempt from it, is honourable.
Surely those proprietors whose own consciences
acquit them of all inhumanity, nay
more, whose general conduct bears testimony
to their kind and liberal feelings towards
these unfortunate dependants, ought
rather to aid our endeavours to reform the
existing abuses, than to strive, by interposing
their character, to shield them from the
view, and, by so doing, to promote their
continuance.</p>

<p class='c010'>Let the West Indians of more enlarged and
generous minds join me rather in examining
into the vices of the existing system, more
especially into those which have hitherto obstructed
the increase of the Negro population.
But to lay before you the various
proofs which could be adduced of those
abuses, would require a volume, and that
not a small one. Want of time, therefore,
will compel me to take a very cursory view
<span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>of this very important part of my subject.
I must content myself with specifying the
chief abuses, referring generally for the
proofs of them, to authentic, but too often
voluminous documents.</p>

<p class='c010'>It might alone however be sufficient, to
establish the positions for which I shall contend,
to refer you to a recent and most valuable
publication, the work of a professional
planter. The author was from the first an
active and able opponent of the Abolitionists.
But being a man of truth and candour, he
has at once furnished a strong argument in
support of their cause, and an invaluable service
to his brethren, the planters, by not only
stating the prevalent vices of the existing
system, but by relating the remedies of
them, which he himself applied, and the reforms
by which, however inadequate, he
acquired, in a few years, a large fortune,
while at the end of that time, he had the
satisfaction to see the number of his Slaves
rapidly and greatly increased.</p>

<p class='c010'>Actuated by motives at once benevolent
and patriotic, desirous of mitigating the sufferings
of the Negroes, and of directing the
planters to those judicious and salutary reforms
which would be found in the end to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>have been not more humane than politic,
he addressed publicly his West Indian brethren,
by whom, both from his general character
for understanding and experience, he
was naturally much respected, and among
whom he was entitled to the more credit for
having been among the foremost to repel
the attack of the Abolitionists. But it was
impossible to address the planters publicly,
without his work being at the same time
read by the friends of abolition. He must
be on his guard therefore, lest he should
afford a triumph to the latter by laying open
the various evils of the West Indian system
in their full extent. He had obviously a
most difficult task to perform; and it is no
more than justice to say that few men ever
performed a difficult task with more ability.
It is impossible, however, to peruse his work
without perceiving in every page that he felt
extremely embarrassed, by wishing to suggest
the most salutary remedies without letting
the world know too much of the disease.
He writes like a man who on the one hand is
conscious that he is prescribing to a patient
who is very liable to take offence, and who
wishes on the other not to disparage the reputation
of the system of management which
had been pursued by the former practitioner.
Hence he rather hints a fault, and hesitates
<span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>dislike, than speaks out plainly. We ought
to bear in mind the author’s peculiar situation,
and its effects, during our perusal of
his work, or we shall form a very inadequate
idea of the real strength of the various
abuses, from the soft colouring with which
he paints them.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The increase a subordinate object of attention.</div>

<p class='c010'>And here I ought to commence with stating,
as a grand and universally operative
cause why the numbers of the Slaves did
not increase more rapidly, that their increase
was not made in general a primary object
of attention. Here also there were individual
instances of a contrary sort, but still
the position is generally true. The dependance
for keeping up the stock of Slaves was
placed not on the increase to be obtained by
births, but on the power of purchasing from
time to time from the Slave market. This
was abundantly proved by positive evidence;
nay, even by the express declaration of the
managers and overseers themselves; but it was
established perhaps still more decisively, by
its being almost invariably found that the most
intelligent West Indians, who were the most
fully acquainted with every other particular
of the system, were commonly utterly ignorant
of all that related to this important
topic. On this head, their minds were a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>mere blank, wholly unfurnished with any of
those particulars with which they must have
been familiar, had the increase of their
Negroes been any great object of their care.
Even medical men, though perfect adepts in
all which regarded planting, appeared quite
at a loss, when questions were asked of them
connected with the breeding and rearing of
children.</p>

<p class='c010'>In some instances, even the colonial statutes
have been framed on the same principles,
and an annual poll-tax has been laid on
Negro Slaves from their earliest infancy.</p>

<p class='c010'>It is not however, that I impute even to the
managers, much less to the proprietors of
West Indian estates, that they entered into
any grave and minute comparison between
the breeding system on the one hand, and the
working down and buying system on the
other, and that they deliberately gave the
preference to the latter as the most economical,
in the full view of all its horrid consequences;
but the truth is, that under all the
circumstances of the West Indian colonies, it
was perfectly natural that the buying rather
than the breeding system should be pursued;
nay, reasoning from experience, I had almost
said, it was scarcely possible that the case should
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>be otherwise, for it was a mode of proceeding
which resulted from causes of sure and universal
operation. Mr. Hume has clearly proved
the truth of this position, in his celebrated
Essay on the populousness of ancient nations;
and he himself, after stating why the buying
system had been preferred among the ancients,
applies the reasoning to our Trans-Atlantic
colonies, and speaks of the confirmation
which his doctrine receives, from the
maxims of our planters, as a known and acknowledged
fact.<a id='r21' /><a href='#f21' class='c011'><sup>[21]</sup></a> From the operation of
similar causes, buying rather than breeding
Slaves became the general policy, among the
nations of antiquity; and hence it will infallibly
continue the general policy in the West
Indies, so long as a Slave market remains
open for a purchaser’s supply.</p>

<p class='c010'>Will not they, who might hesitate to adopt
this position, be disposed at least to deem it
probable, when they hear, that, notwithstanding
all the steps which have been taken, for
so many years, towards the abolition of the
Slave Trade; even yet, the price of women
Slaves continues, as it has always been, inferior
to that of men. This is the more
curious, because our opponents have uniformly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>alleged their not having a due proportion of
females, as a primary cause of their not keeping
up their numbers. It is obvious, that
this is a cause which could, at the utmost,
only exist among the imported Africans, and
that there would be the usual proportion of
males and females among the Slaves born in
the islands, which, in all but the new settlements,
constitute beyond all comparison the
bulk of the Black population. What then
can shew more clearly, that the planters do
not, even yet, set themselves in earnest to
produce an increase by breeding, than that,
under an exaggerated impression of the effects
of importing a too small proportion of females,
and with a probability, at least, of
abolition before their eyes, they suffer it to
continue the interest of the Slave merchant,
in preference to bring over males.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Vices of the West Indian system:—Insufficient feeding.</div>

<p class='c010'>I must begin my enumeration of the abuses
of the West Indian system, by mentioning
<em>insufficient feeding</em>.  It must be granted,
indeed, that in this particular, the Slaves are
very differently circumstanced in different
islands. In the larger island of Jamaica, for
instance, and in Dominica, wherein the Slaves
can be chiefly fed by provisions produced on
the estate, their quantity of food is far more
ample than in those islands where the land
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>is so valuable, that little or none of it can
be spared for this service; where also the
droughts are so frequent and great, that the
Negroes own provision grounds furnish but a
very precarious and scanty supply. It might
be sufficient to mention, that the allowance of
provisions alleged to have been commonly
given to the working Slaves, in most of the
Leeward Islands, was not above half the
quantity which, by an act of Assembly, lately
passed in Jamaica, was required to be given
to such runaway Slaves as, having been taken
up, were lodged in prison till they could be
returned to their masters. A prison allowance
is not meant to be such as will pamper the
body; yet double the food given in the
former case to the working Negroes, was prescribed
for a Slave in prison, who had nothing
to do. I might also mention that acknowledged
truth, that during the five or six
months of crop time, when the labour is the
most severe, the Slaves uniformly become
much stouter and fatter, from the nourishment
derived from the cane juice.</p>

<p class='c010'>But as time will not allow me to prove the
point completely, let me abstain from an
imperfect enumeration of arguments, and
satisfy myself with affirming, that I am fully
warranted by the very respectable authority
<span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>just now alluded to, in placing insufficient
feeding among the general vices of the West
Indian system; though in Jamaica, and in
some of the other islands, the lands allotted to
the Slaves for raising their food is sufficient, had
they but time enough for working it.<a id='r22' /><a href='#f22' class='c011'><sup>[22]</sup></a> I will
<span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>only remark farther, that in America, where
the Slaves increase so rapidly, the quantity of
food allowed to the Negroes was vastly greater
than the largest West Indian allowance.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Defects in point of clothing and lodging.</div>

<p class='c010'>Clothing and lodging are, in the West
Indian climate, less important particulars;
yet in them too there is room for improvement,
as there is also in the point of medical
care. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Overworking.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
Overworking is a still more important
hindrance, in which perhaps the excess in the
continuance of the labour, is more injurious
than in its intensity. And here I might call
<span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>in Mr. Long as a witness, from whose experience
on this head there ought to be no appeal.
The passage is well worthy of attention:
“I will not deny that those Negroes breed
the best, whose labour is least, or easiest.
Thus the domestic Negroes have more children
than those on penns, and the latter
than those who are employed on sugar plantations.
If the number of hogsheads,
annually made from any estate, exceeds, or
even equals, the whole aggregate of Negroes
employed upon it, but few children
will be brought up on such estate, whatever
number may be born. But, where
the proportion of the annual produce is
about half a hogshead for every Negro,
there they will, in all likelihood, increase
very rapidly; and not much less so, where
the <em>ratio</em> is of two hogsheads to every three
Negroes, which I take to be a good <i><span lang="fro" xml:lang="fro">mesne</span></i>
proportion.” Does it not then indisputably
follow, that where the Slaves diminish,
it is owing to the labour being disproportionate
to their strength?</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Moral defects of the West Indian system.</div>

<p class='c010'>But of all the vices of the West Indian
system which tend to prevent the increase,
those which may be termed the moral vices
and preventives, are those on which I must
insist most strongly, and on which also I must
<span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>dwell more particularly, because even by benevolent
and liberal minds they have been too
generally neglected. These are of all others
the most efficient; since, in their consequences,
they naturally produce the existence, or at
least the aggravation of all the rest. Of these
let me first specify the practice of polygamy,
and much more the almost universal dissoluteness
and debauchery of the Negro Slaves.
These are evils which have been almost always
assigned by the West Indian gentlemen themselves,
as the grand obstacle to the production
and rearing of children. And yet,
strange as it may seem, no attempts whatever
appear to have been made, excepting by
three or four enlightened and liberal proprietors,
to reform these abuses. Can a more
decisive proof be afforded, either that the
increase of the Negroes was never any serious
object of general attention, or that the prejudices
and passions of men often make them
act contrary to their clear and known interest?
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Neglect of
religious instruction.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
No efforts have been made for the religious
instruction and moral improvement of
the Negroes, and any plans of that kind,
when adopted by others, have been considered
as chimerical, if not dangerous. This is
the more extraordinary, because an example
on a large scale, has been of late years furnished
in the little Danish islands, and in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>one settlement, at least, of our own smaller
islands, of the happiest effects resulting from
such endeavours: so that men of great knowledge
and experience in West Indian affairs, in
estimating the effects of the labours of the
missionaries, who were employed in this benevolent
service, by a pecuniary standard,
declared, that a Slave, by becoming one of
their converts, was worth half as much more
than his former value, on account of his superior
morality, sobriety, industry, subordination,
and general good conduct.<a id='r23' /><a href='#f23' class='c011'><sup>[23]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>In the French islands, likewise, the religious
instruction of the Slaves was an object
of very general care; and the intelligent West
Indian Writer before alluded to, frankly declares,
“that no person who has visited the
French islands can deny, that in consequence
of the improvements derived from this source,
their Slaves are incomparably better disposed
than our own.” This is no singular opinion,
and the Governor of Dominica stated an undeniable
truth, when, in answer to the queries
sent out by his Majesty, he declared, that
“he was satisfied it was principally from this
cause (of religious instruction), that the
French Slaves were, in general, better, more
<span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>attached, more contented, more healthy, more
cleanly than ours.” Their greater attachment
and contentment are the more worthy of remark,
because it is pretty generally agreed,
that they were treated with more severity,
and worked harder than our own.</p>

<p class='c010'>In the Portuguese settlements also, and
probably in the Spanish likewise, the religious
instruction of the Slaves has ever been regarded
as a concern of high importance.</p>

<p class='c010'>Might we not then have expected that our
own West Indian Proprietors would be
prompted, not only by considerations of self-interest,
but by motives of a still higher order,
to pay some attention to the religious instruction
of their Negroes? Might not mere humanity
have enforced the same important
duty? Might we not have hoped, that the
Slaves of this Protestant and free nation,
might have had some compensation made to
them, for the evils of their temporal bondage,
by a prospect being opened to them of a happier
world hereafter, a world of light and liberty?
But, alas! no such cheering prospects
are pointed out to them. It is left, alas! to
Paganism to administer to them, I had almost
said happily, a faint imitation of that
more animating hope which Christianity
<span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>should impart; and these poor beings are
comforted by the idea, that death will once
more restore them to their native land; on
which account it is, that, as we learn from
most respectable testimony, the negro funerals
in the West Indies are seasons of joy
and triumph, whereas in Africa, they are
accompanied with the usual indications of
dejection and sorrow.<a id='r24' /><a href='#f24' class='c011'><sup>[24]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Degradation of the Negro race.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c010'>But though this neglect of the religious
and moral instruction of the Slaves, so manifestly
leading to the master’s immediate interest,
may surprize on the first view, the problem
will be completely solved on a farther insight
into the system of management; and the
mischief may be traced, if I mistake not, to a
sure source of numerous and most malignant
evils. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Degradation of the Negro race.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> For the various moral defects of the
negro system appear to me often to be almost
entirely caused, and always to be extremely
augmented, by the Negroes, as a race,
being sunk into the lowest state of degradation.</p>

<p class='c010'>That this was to be naturally expected,
will be obvious to every reflecting mind,
which considers, that, for many successive
generations, the Negroes have not only been
an inferior cast, a race of slaves, the slaves too
<span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>of men enjoying themselves, political freedom,
and therefore elevated above them to a
still higher point; but that there is a variety
of circumstances, not forgetting that most
important particular of colour, all tending
powerfully to designate, and stamp them, as a
peculiar, and that a base and degraded order
of beings.</p>

<p class='c010'>These are considerations of inexpressible
importance; for these are they, which, by
extinguishing sympathy, render the yoke of
African slavery so peculiarly galling, and
make it press on the West Indian Slave with
such aggravated weight. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>West Indian compared with ancient slavery.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> Slavery, we know,
existed among the ancients; and according to
the savage maxims of Pagan warfare,(too
strikingly agreeing with the mode of carrying
on war which the Slave Trade has produced
in Africa), not only the soldiery of an
enemy, but the peaceable inhabitants of conquered
countries were commonly sold as
Slaves. But what an idea does it convey of
the abhorred system, which, with coadjutors
abler than myself, I have been so long endeavouring
to abolish; that, just as in Africa,
it has forced Christianity to acknowledge the
superior power of Mahometanism, in rooting
out the native superstitions, and in instructing
and civilizing the inhabitants—so in our possessions
in the western Hemisphere, it combines
<span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>the profession of the christian faith
with a description of slavery, in many respects
more bitter in its sufferings, than that
which the very darkness of Paganism itself
could scarcely tolerate.</p>

<p class='c010'>This is the more grievous to those who
duly venerate and love our most pure and
excellent form of christian faith, because to
have first mitigated the evils of slavery, and
at length in a great degree to have abolished
the institution itself, have been numbered
among the peculiar glories of Christianity;<a id='r25' /><a href='#f25' class='c011'><sup>[25]</sup></a>
and because, what we deem a corrupted
system of Christianity, has produced highly
beneficial effects on the negro Slaves of our
Roman Catholic neighbours in the same
quarter. I cannot now enlarge on this topic;
but thus much I must state, that the single
particular, that the Slaves among the ancients
were in general of the same complexion,
features, and form, with their masters, was of
itself a consideration of extreme importance.
These masters were aware their situation was
one, into which they themselves might be reduced
<span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>by the fortune of war: this circumstance,
together with the frequent elevation of
Slaves to occupations of the highest confidence
and importance, with a prospect, frequently
realized, of emerging by emancipation into a
state of liberty and comfort, was sufficient to
render their condition infinitely preferable to
that of our West Indian Slaves.<a id='r26' /><a href='#f26' class='c011'><sup>[26]</sup></a> In the case
of ancient slavery, instead of there being no
place for sympathy, it was often in lively
exercise; but even still more, hope was not
extinguished; hope, the cordial drop of life,
that on which, perhaps, more than on all
which rank, and wealth; and power, and
prosperity can give, depends the happiness of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>man. But to the West Indian Slave, on the
contrary, his colour, his features, his form,
his language, his employment, all tend on the
one hand to extinguish sympathy, and on the
other to shut him up as it were close and
bound in his dreary dungeon, without a ray
of light, without a chance of escape, the
victim at once of degradation and despair.</p>

<p class='c010'>Can it be necessary for me, in order to
justify myself for dilating on so invidious a
topic as that of the degradation of the negro
race, to insist on the important effects which
this degradation must necessarily produce in
all the various particulars of negro treatment?
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Important effects of Negro degradation.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> Let me not here be misunderstood. The degradation
of which I shall speak, and of which,
while it continues, I must ever speak in terms
of indignation, as of a gross infraction on the
just claims of our common species, is not to
be regarded as important, only, or chiefly, in
the view of its being an outrage on the feelings
of the Negroes themselves. If that
were all, I might perhaps be charged with
over-refining, and with measuring the opinions
and feelings of the Slaves by a standard
justly applicable only to men of far more enlightened
and elevated minds. Though, even
in this view, what an idea does it convey to
us of their wretched state! How scanty must
<span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>be their stock of comforts, when their very
happiness is to arise from their being insensible
to circumstances of humiliation, which
all but a brute must understand and feel.</p>

<p class='c010'>Hitherto it has been deemed one of the
most debasing effects of slavery, to render
men insensible to the extremity of their own
degradation; and it is a new way of considering
things to regard this insensibility as
an alleviation of their wretchedness. But,
alas! this degradation makes itself but too
intelligible to the meanest capacity, and the
most unfeeling heart. Its effects are such
as come home at every turn to the Negroes’
“business and bosoms.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Surely it would be a waste of time to prove
to you in detail, that, throughout all nature,
but especially in the human species, in proportion
as any being is considered as possessing
a higher or a lower place in the scale
of existence, in that same proportion shall
we be disposed to consider him as entitled to
a larger share of our kind consideration; in
short, in the same proportion will sympathy
be awakened in his behalf, and sympathy is the
great author and cherisher of every benevolent
emotion. In that same proportion shall we
be inclined to reflect on his situation, to spare
<span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>his feelings, to multiply his comforts; in
short, to pour, even though with a cautious
hand, some drops of comfort into a cup,
which, at best, must be but bitter, and of
which, wherever sympathy is in exercise,
we feel that we ourselves might have been
fated to drink. Whatever, therefore, tends
to depress that wretched class of our fellow
creatures, beneath that low level which in
any case they are doomed to occupy, tends
compendiously and infallibly to the counteraction
of every thing good, and the aggravation
of every thing evil, in their unhappy lot.</p>

<p class='c010'>Let it not then be thought, that in the odious
recital which will follow, I am influenced
by any invidious or ungenerous feelings towards
the colonial Proprietors. I have a solemn
duty to discharge, and however painful
the task, however invidious, however liable
to misconstruction, I must not shrink from it.
It may be enough, I hope, to touch on the
chief humiliating particulars.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Instances of degradation.</div>

<p class='c010'>And, first, comes in that most degrading
spectacle of a negro sale.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>A negro sale.</div>

<p class='c010'>Mr. Edwards himself acknowledges with
frankness and liberality, that “there is something
extremely shocking to a humane and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>cultivated mind, in the idea of beholding a
numerous body of our unfortunate fellow
creatures in captivity and exile, exposed
naked to public view, and sold like a herd of
cattle.”<a id='r27' /><a href='#f27' class='c011'><sup>[27]</sup></a> But the account given of one of
those sales by a late traveller, in his highly
instructive and interesting work,<a id='r28' /><a href='#f28' class='c011'><sup>[28]</sup></a> will convey
a more precise idea of the scene:—“The
poor Africans, says he, who were to be sold,
were exposed naked, in a large empty building
like an open barn.  Those who came
with intention to purchase, minutely inspected
them; handled them, made them jump,
and stamp with their feet, and throw out
their arms and their legs; turned them about;
looked into their mouths; and, according to
the usual rules of traffic with respect to cattle,
examined them; and made them show themselves
in a variety ways, to try if they were
sound and healthy. All this was distressful
and humiliating; but a wound still more severe
was inflicted on the feelings, by some of
the purchasers selecting only such as their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>judgment led them to prefer, regardless of
the bonds of nature and affection.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“The husband was taken from the wife,
children separated from their parents, and
the lover torn from his mistress.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“In one part of the building was seen a
wife clinging to her husband. Here was a
sister hanging upon the neck of her brother.
There stood two brothers enfolded in each
others arms, mutually bewailing their threatened
separation. In other parts were friends,
relatives, and companions, praying to be sold
to the same master, using signs to signify
that they would be content with slavery,
might they but toil together.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Silent tears, deep sighs, and heavy lamentations,
bespoke the universal suffering of
these poor Blacks. Never was the<a id='t135'></a> scene more
distressful. Among these unhappy, degraded
Africans, scarcely was there an unclouded
countenance.”</p>

<p class='c010'>To the honour of the Legislature of Jamaica,
the consolidated Slave Act, which
passed in 1788, contained a proviso, which
Mr. Edwards himself subsequently endeavored
to carry into more complete effect,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>that, as far as possible, there should be no separation
of the different branches of the same
family. I might remark that such a law,
from the very nature of the case, would be
very imperfectly executed. But even where
no such humane condition has been prescribed,
let me observe, that it is not so much
to my present purpose to notice the violence
done to the domestic and social feelings of the
Slaves, as to point out the tendency which
the whole scene must have, to degrade and
vilify the wretched beings in the eyes of the
spectators.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Sales of Negroes for Owners’ debts.</div>

<p class='c010'>It is another particular in the situation of
these poor creatures, which should here be
noticed; that they are personal estate, or
moveable property, and that hence they are
liable to be seized and sold for their Owner’s
debts. This operates the more unfavourably
towards them, because, in the West Indies,
there is always a more rapid change of property
than in any other country; and never
has there been more speculation, never more
general difficulty and distress, consequently
never more seizures and sales, than during
the last twenty or thirty years.</p>

<p class='c010'>These continual sales, often commonly by
auction, not only of recently imported, but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>of homeborn and long-settled Negroes, are
productive of the most acute sufferings to the
Slaves, by tearing open, in the Africans, the
old wounds, which might after many years
have closed, and by forcing them once more
from their homes, their families, and connections,
when they had perhaps taken root
in their West Indian soil, and multiplied their
domestic and social holdings. These transplantations,
besides, greatly tend to lessen
the little disposition which the Slaves, circumstanced
as they are, naturally feel, to endeavour
to gain a good character, and obtain a
master’s confidence, in the hope that they
and their families may possess a place in his
esteem. There is an object which it is obvious
will operate most severely in the case of
the most industrious and best-conditioned
Slaves. In proportion as they are of this character,
they are likely to have multiplied their
domestic and friendly relations, and in and
about their dwelling-places to have collected
such little comforts as have been within their
reach, and as have tended to cause home to
present, even to them, an idea of consolation
and refreshment. But all of them have some
home, all have some relatives and acquaintances.
From all these they are hurried
away, often necessarily separated from the
closest of all connections. They are sent,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>probably, to form new settlements, when, perhaps,
past the prime of life, and to encounter
hardships, and endure labours, to which their
bodily strength is scarcely equal.<a id='r29' /><a href='#f29' class='c011'><sup>[29]</sup></a> At least
they have to form a new home, new connections,
new attachments; and, when the
best of their days have now been spent in
vain, how must the spirits, even of the well
disposed, sink within them, under the consciousness
that they have to recommend themselves
to a new master, when, from the mere
decay of their bodily powers, they cannot
hope, by the alacrity and vigour of their services,
to obtain any considerable share of notice
or esteem; or when, if at an earlier period
of life, they are discouraged from attempting
it, by the probability, that ere long they may
again be transferred to a new owner.</p>

<p class='c010'>But I wish you not so much to keep in view
the deep wounds which the happiness of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>Slaves must sustain from these frequent sales.
It is to my present purpose to consider their
effect in accustoming men to disregard their
comforts and feelings. It is impossible but
that such incidents must tend powerfully, and
in various ways, to vilify and degrade the
Blacks in the general estimation, and hence
to produce an habitual disregard to their comforts
and feelings.</p>

<p class='c010'>It may be proper to state, that it was urged
by our West Indian opponents, that the grievance
we have been now considering, may
fairly be laid to the charge of the British
Parliament, having been sanctioned by a statute
passed in the time of George the Second,
for the security of the creditor in the mother
country. The West Indian legislatures, it
was added, were bound not to enact any
provision contrary to the laws of England,
and were therefore forced to endure this cruel
and pernicious law.</p>

<p class='c010'>It would not be difficult to shew that this
charge is not well founded; but it may suffice,
for the present, to remark, that, even granting
that the effect of the 5th of Geo. 2d was such
as is here supposed, yet that Slaves were not
for the first time rendered by that law personal
property, and liable to be sold separate
<span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>from the land for the payment of the simple
contract debts of the Master. They have always
been in that wretched state. Still more
it might truly be alleged, that the Legislature
of this country was utterly ignorant of the
effect of the law on the happiness of the
Negroes, and not even a hint was dropped on
that subject by any one of the many West
Indian Gentlemen in Parliament; and, when
the mischievous effects of the statute were
explained, Parliament immediately and unanimously
consented to the very first proposal
which was made for repealing it. We do
not find however, that the West Indian legislatures
have availed themselves of the acknowledged
right of rescinding it, which they
now enjoy.  Supposing therefore, what is
not however the fact, that, in this instance
only, the British Parliament and the Colonial
legislatures, the former utterly ignorant of all
the practical evils resulting to the Slaves from
the law in question, the latter having them
daily before their eyes, to have been both
parties to the wrong; we have at least done
our part towards redressing the injury; they
have not done theirs.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The universal practice of working under the whip.</div>

<p class='c010'>The next particular which must be mentioned,
is, like all the rest, at once an evidence
and an effect of the degraded state of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>Negroes. It is that universal and established
practice of working them under the whip
like cattle.<a id='r30' /><a href='#f30' class='c011'><sup>[30]</sup></a> And here is it possible for any
<span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>one not to feel peculiarly shocked at the idea
of working females in this method; the consequence
of which must unavoidably be, that
notwithstanding the immunities which may
be allowed in more advanced stages of pregnancy,
or even as soon as a woman is known
to be in that state, yet that females will
in fact be often worked in this mode, at
times, and under circumstances, when Nature
peculiarly calls for forbearance, tenderness,
and support. Let me repeat, that it is not
civilization merely, and politeness, as sometimes
happens in the case of artificial wants;
it is Nature herself, which, in such circumstances,
claims some sympathy and indulgence.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>And is this a time, are these
circumstances, in which a female should be
urged to her labour by the stroke, or even
the crack of the whip? To view the practice
in a mere mercenary view, surely if the
West Indian Gentlemen had been seriously
and earnestly intent on superseding the necessity
of purchasing from the Slave market,
by rearing Negroes on their own estates, the
younger women at least, if employed in field-work
at all, would not be worked in this
rude and undistinguishing manner, when a
single inconsiderate lash of the driver’s whip,
intended not as a punishment, but as a quickener,
or a memento, may in its consequences,
prevent the birth of a future infant. Surely
I need not enlarge on this disgusting topic,
or enumerate in detail the various evils which
must result from so hateful a practice; it’s
tendency greatly to lessen, if not almost utterly
to extinguish in the Slaves, all honest,
I had almost said, all mercenary emulation or
competition, all the hopes of obtaining a
master’s approbation and confidence; it’s admitting
no occasional remissions of labour,
afterwards to be compensated by increased
exertions; it’s making no allowance for different
states of mind or body; but, without
inquiry as to these, as the post-horse is to go
through his stage, so the Slave under the same
impulse is to keep up with his fellows: In
<span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>short, it’s utter forgetfulness of <em>mind</em> in the
human subject, who is thus considered and
treated as of an inferior species, as not capable
of being worked upon by the ordinary motives
of the hope of reward, or even the fear
of punishment; as one who, like the vilest of
the brute species, has no foresight or recollection,
and must therefore be subjected to the
same humiliating regimen.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Cruel and indecent public punishments of Slaves.</div>

<p class='c010'>Another particular, concerning which I am
doubtful whether it ought to be noticed chiefly
as a cause of the degradation of the Negro
race, or as an evidence and effect of that degradation,
is the cruel, and, in the case of the
female sex, still more the highly indecent
punishments inflicted in places of public resort,
and in the face of day. Unless the feelings
of sympathy towards Blacks, as fellow creatures,
or of decency respecting them as of our
own species, were not, to so great a degree,
extinct, such exhibitions would not be continued,
if from no better motive, yet because
they would counteract their own effect, when
they were the execution of a public sentence,
by interesting all beholders in favour of the
criminal, and bringing, to use the phrase of
our law, the Government into hatred and contempt;
or because, when they were punishments
ordered by a master or mistress, besides
probably producing a riot, they would render
<span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>those who ordered them the subject of general
obloquy. But, regarded as Blacks now
are by the bulk of the population, there seems
to have been no fear lest public executions,
by the most cruel and protracted tortures,
should be matter of public scandal. As for the
punishments of Owners, when General T.
saw the shameless and cruel flogging, on
the public parade, of two very decent women,
who, while waiting at table where he was
visiting, had been ordered by their mistress,
in spite of his expostulations, to go with the
Jumper (or public Flogger), to receive a dozen,
each stroke of which brought flesh from
them, we do not find that the incident excited
any surprize or attention in any one but the
General himself.<a id='r31' /><a href='#f31' class='c011'><sup>[31]</sup></a> If such could be the treatment
sanctioned by public opinion, and general
feeling, of decent young women, publicly
and in the face of day, what consideration
would be likely to be paid to the comforts
and feelings of the field Negroes, who are
regarded as a far inferior race to the domestics,
especially when there are no officious
bystanders to witness what may take place.</p>

<p class='c010'>Let me but ask, what must be the effect
necessarily produced on the mind from having
been habituated to such scenes as these from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>early infancy? Can we be surprized to hear
that, too often, even the delicacy and tenderness
of the female sex is not proof against the
natural consequences of daily beholding such
spectacles?<a id='r32' /><a href='#f32' class='c011'><sup>[32]</sup></a> Should we not be almost prepared
to find, the particular which I confess
has ever most deeply affected my mind as
being of all others the most decisive proof
of the utter vileness and degradation of the
Negro race, <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Other signs of degradation.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> that utter contempt which too generally prevails of their social and domestic
feelings; that they are too commonly regarded
as below instruction, below the range of moral
precepts and prohibitions, below the sphere
of the obligations, duties, restraints, and comforts
of conjugal, domestic, and social life.</p>

<p class='c010'>Hence, doubtless, proceeds their being in
some degree regarded, like their fellow brutes,
as below the necessity of observing towards
others the proper decencies of life, or of
having these decencies observed by others
towards them. Hence, while Mr. Parke assures
us, that in Africa, adultery is not more
frequent than in this country, we hear the
most respectable Colonists treat the very idea
of introducing marriage among the Slaves, in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>their present state, as perfectly hopeless or
ridiculous.</p>

<p class='c010'>Do we not here find the explanation of that
strange phenomenon, formerly mentioned,
that while the prevalence and evils of dissoluteness
are universally acknowledged, scarcely
any one thinks of applying that which has
already appeared from experience so safe, so
appropriate, and so beneficial a remedy?</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Inadequate legal protection.</div>

<p class='c010'>But it is time to pass to another most important
particular, which, like those already
mentioned, is at once both cause and effect,
both an evidence and a consequence of degradation—the
inadequate protection afforded to
the Slaves by the laws.</p>

<p class='c010'>Here again let me not be misunderstood.
It is not the matter of my present complaint,
that, from the inadequate penalties annexed to
the ill-treatment of Negro Slaves, and that
still more from the evidence of black and
coloured men not being admissible, they are
subject to the restraints of civilized society,
without being partakers of its benefits. Much
might be said, much has been said, to prove
how insufficiently they are secured by the laws
against injuries and insults. On the other
hand, considerable stress, too has sometimes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>been laid on the mildness of the penalties
where the offences of Slaves were to be
punished, and still more on the laws which
have from time to time been passed for the
protection of Slaves. The former assertion
might be but too effectually disproved, by appealing
to various passages in the Colonial
statute book; and, where admitted, the lenity
might be traced to a cause less generous
than disinterested humanity. It might have
been suggested to one of the most powerful
of our colonial opponents, who urged that capital
executions of Slaves had taken place in
very few instances, that they might naturally
be expected to be more rare, and punishments
in general more lenient, where men’s
own property would suffer from severity.</p>

<p class='c010'>Concerning all laws for the protection of
the Slaves, it might be justly remarked, that
so far as the protection of Slaves is concerned
against ill usage from all but their
Masters, it was natural that the Slaves of any
man should be protected equally with his
cattle, or any other articles of his property;
nor did the Slaves, any more than the cattle,
owe this protection to the humanity of the
legislature. They were protected merely like
the rest of his substance.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>But as to the far more important consideration,
concerning legal protection from the
Owner’s ill usage, it is unquestionably true,
that be the laws what they may, “so long as
the evidence of black or coloured men against
whites continues inadmissible,” the latter,
in all that respects the treatment of Negroes,
are “in a manner put beyond the reach of
the law.” Such were the very words in
which a much respected Colonial Proprietor,
though called as one of our opponents witnesses,
acknowledged the important truth.</p>

<p class='c010'>His testimony on this head was the more
worthy of attention, because, besides his long
residence in the West Indies, and his known
intelligence and habits of observation, he
was for some time Chief Justice of one of our
islands. He also acknowledged, that till
black evidence should be admissible, he knew
no possible mode of preventing the most gross
infractions of any laws against the ill-treatment
of Negroes. The subsequent death of
this valuable man is deeply to be regretted;
because, with several of his immediate connections,
he was exempt from many of the
prejudices which, in colonial proprietors, too
often obstruct the reform of West Indian
abuses.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>A remarkable proof was afforded how
little the Slaves were regarded as under the
protection of law, against their Masters ill
usage, by a transaction which took place a
few years ago, in one of our oldest sugar colonies,
and of which an account is contained
in the Privy Council report:</p>

<p class='c010'>A man, named Herbert, in low circumstances,
and of very indifferent character, had
been guilty of an act of the most wanton cruelty,
which was rendered still more atrocious by
being committed against the helplessness of
infancy. He had most wantonly and cruelly
lacerated the mouth and face of a child six
years old, his own Slave, in a shocking manner,
and bruised various parts of its little body.
The crime happened to be committed under
circumstances which admitted of legal proof,
and, owing to the benevolent and spirited exertions
of a man of legal eminence, who then
resided in the neighbourhood, and who himself
was able to give decisive evidence, a prosecution
was carried on against the perpetrator.
The facts were clearly established, and
most horrible they were; yet so strange and
novel a doctrine did it appear to the jury,
that a Master was liable to punishment for
any act of cruelty exercised on his own Slave,
that, after long consultation, they brought in a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>conditional verdict, “Guilty, subject to the
opinion of the Court, if immoderate correction
of a Slave, by his Master, be a crime
indictable.” The Court determined in the
affirmative; and what was the punishment
of this abominable act of barbarity? A fine
of forty shillings currency, equivalent to about
thirty shillings of our money! This was the
more extraordinary, because only two years
before, in consequence of some recent acts of
abominable cruelty, an Act of Assembly had
been passed for the express purpose of preventing
barbarities of a similar nature, and a
fine of £.500 currency, together with six
months imprisonment, had been annexed as
the punishment of such offences. But so
little were the enactments of law in unison
with the general feelings of the bulk of the
people, that even after this statute had been
passed, not only did a jury doubt whether
the most wanton barbarity towards an infant,
by its owner, was liable to any punishment;
but the idea of calling a Master to account
for this ill-treatment of one of his own Slaves
created a popular ferment, and a violent cry
against the prosecutors of the delinquent, and
was resented as a gross and novel infraction
of the rights and privileges of ownership.
This very Herbert afterwards brought his
action against the Provost Marshal, for having
<span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>taken the poor unoffending boy into his custody,
partly that the child might be forth-coming,
partly to save him from the violence of
his brutal Master. The Provost Marshal, after
a long course of judicial proceeding, would
have had heavy penalties to pay, had he not
got off on a point of law. Herbert was considered
as a persecuted man, and became a
highly popular character in the community.</p>

<p class='c010'>But that which renders this incident most of
all worthy of remark, is, that unsatisfactory as
the issue might appear to us to have been, a
detailed account of it, with some other instances
too much in the same spirit, was sent
over to the Privy Council, by the Council and
Assembly of the island, with some apparent
satisfaction, as a proof of the protection enjoyed
by the Slaves against immoderate punishment
or cruelty on the part of their Masters.</p>

<p class='c010'>Not to insist in this place on the impossibility
of enforcing any laws which may
be enacted for the protection and comfort of
Slaves, a topic on which I may have occasion
to say more hereafter, law and slavery are,
in their own nature, absolutely and universally
incompatible. The Slave’s best protection
must ever be found in his Master’s kindness,
especially where kindness is combined with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>affluence; and, by giving to the Slaves a nominal
right to definite legal privileges, you
only infuse a spirit of discontent into them,
and a spirit of suspicion and resentment into
their Masters; at least, until the absolute
nullity of the law be clearly manifest to both
parties. The Master has not the same motives
for tenderness, (motives ever powerful
in a generous mind) as when all right, all
rivalship are excluded, and he knows that his
Slaves are given up completely into his power;
that they are entirely dependent on his will,
and that they must receive every favour as
flowing altogether from his spontaneous beneficence.
It is not therefore going too far, to
affirm, that by destroying, or at least impairing,
the force of these feelings, you do the
Slave more harm, than can be compensated
by any benefit he can derive from the laws.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Considered in the view of its degrading effects.</div>

<p class='c010'>But to quit this view of the subject, it is
the effect, in another direction, of this inadequate
protection of the laws, to which I
wish to point your particular attention. I
wish you to observe the proofs which it affords
of the low estimate of the Negro race; as well
as the tendency which it must have to keep
them in their present abject and depressed
condition.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>But here, instead of quoting passages from
the statute books and judicial records of the
several islands, which might be objected to,
as an unfair test of the opinions and feelings
of the present generation, I will extract from
a set of papers, laid not long ago before the
House of Commons by Government, the
account, given from the most respectable
authority, of some transactions which have
recently taken place, and which shew the degraded
state of the Negro race in, excepting
Jamaica, the largest and oldest settled of all
our West Indian colonies.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Late incidents in Barbadoes.</div>

<p class='c010'>The Governor of Barbadoes, Lord Seaforth
himself, I understand, an old West Indian
proprietor, in consonance with the wishes of
many respectable inhabitants, endeavoured
lately, from the most honourable motives, to
procure the repeal of a law which had long
been the disgrace of the Barbadoes statute
book, and for the rescinding of which an
effort had been in vain made a few years
before; a law, by which the wilful murder of
a Slave was punishable only by a fine of £.15.
currency, or about £.11. 4<em>s</em>. sterling<a id='r33' /><a href='#f33' class='c011'><sup>[33]</sup></a>. His
Lordship therefore sent a message in the
common form to the House of Assembly, recommending
<span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>that an act should be passed to
make the murder of a Slave a capital felony.
There seems every reason to believe that the
Council, or Colonial House of Lords, would
gladly have assented to the proposition. But,
strange as it may appear to those who are unacquainted
with the West Indian prejudices,
notwithstanding the time and manner in
which the proposition was brought forward,
the House of Assembly absolutely refused to
make the alteration. But if the bare statement
of this fact must shock every liberal
mind, how much will the shock be increased,
when it is known under what circumstances
it was that this refusal took place.</p>

<p class='c010'>For it happened, that, very recently, several
of the most wanton and atrocious murders
had been committed. Some of these were
accompanied with circumstances of such
horrid and disgusting barbarity, as to be too
shocking for recital; and yet it scarcely seems
justifiable to allow such horrid deeds, from
their very atrociousness, to derive impunity.
But one of the accounts you must submit to
hear, because the narrative contains circumstances
which strikingly illustrate the condition
and estimation of the Negro race. To
myself, to say the truth, it tells me, in the view
in which I shall here regard it, nothing more
<span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>than I already knew; but it was scarcely to
be expected that Providence would furnish
such undeniable and glaring proofs, of the
assertions we had before established by the
most respectable testimony.</p>

<p class='c010'><em>Extract of a Letter from the Right Hon.
Lord Seaforth, to Earl Camden, one of
His Majesty’s principal Secretaries of State,
dated Barbadoes, 7th Jan. 1805.</em></p>

<p class='c010'>“I inclose the Attorney General’s letter
to me on the subject of the Negroes so
most wantonly murdered. I am sorry to
say, <em>several other instances of the same barbarity</em>
have occurred, with which I have
not troubled your Lordship, as I only
wished to make you acquainted with the
subject in general.”</p>

<p class='c010'>It will be enough for me to quote that part
of the Attorney General’s letter in which he
gives the account of the single murder which
I wish to lay before you:</p>

<p class='c010'><em>Extract of a Letter from the Attorney General
of Barbadoes, to the Governor of the Island.</em></p>

<p class='c010'>“A Mr. ——, the manager of a plantation
in the neighbourhood, had some
months before purchased an African lad,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>who was much attached to his person, and
slept in a passage contiguous to his chamber.
On Sunday night there was an alarm of
fire in the plantation, which induced
Mr. —— to go out hastily, and the next
morning he missed the lad, who he supposed
intended to follow him in the night, and had
mistaken his way. He sent to his neighbours,
and to Mr. C—— among the rest,
to inform them that his African lad had
accidently strayed from him; that he
could not speak a word of English, and
that possibly he might be found breaking
canes, or taking something else for his
support; in which case he requested that
they would not injure him, but return him,
and he would pay any damage he might
have committed. A day or two after,
the Owner of the boy was informed, that
Mr. C. and H. had killed a Negro in a
neighbouring gully, and buried him there.
He went to Mr. C—— to inquire into the
truth of the report, and intended to have
the grave opened, to see whether it was
his African lad. <em>Mr. C—— told him,
a Negro had been killed and buried there;
but assured him it was not his, for he knew
him very well, and he need not be at the trouble
of opening the grave. Upon this the
Owner went away satisfied.</em> But receiving
<span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>further information, which left no doubt
upon his mind that it was his Negro, he
returned and opened the grave, and found
it to be so. I was his leading counsel, and
the facts stated in my brief were as follow:
That C. and H. being informed that there
was a Negro lurking in the gully, went
armed with muskets, and took several
negro men with them. The poor African
seeing a parcel of men coming to attack
him, was frightened; he took up a stone
to defend himself, and retreated into a
cleft rock, where they could not easily
come at him; they then went for some
trash, put it into the crevice of the rock
behind him, and set it on fire; after it
had burnt so as to scorch the poor fellow,
he ran into a pool of water near by; they
sent a Negro to bring him out, and he
threw the stone at the Negro; upon
which the two white men fired several
times at him with the guns loaded with
shot, and the Negroes pelted him with
stones. He was at length dragged out of
the pool in a dying condition, for he had
not only received several bruises from the
stones, but his breast was so pierced with
the shot, that it was like a cullender. <em>The
white savages ordered the Negroes to dig a
grave, and whilst they were digging it, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>poor creature made signs of begging for water;
which was not given to him, but as soon as
the grave was dug, he was thrown into it,
and covered over; and there seems to be some
doubt whether he was then quite dead.</em>—C.
and H. deny this; but the Owner
assured me that he could prove it by more
than one witness; and I have reason to believe
it to be true, because on the day of
trial, C. and H. did not suffer the cause
to come to a hearing, but paid the penalties
and the costs of suit, which it is not
supposed they would have done had they
been innocent.</p>

<div class='lg-container-r'>

    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>I have the honour to be, &amp;c.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>The same transaction, with another far
more dreadful murder, in which there was a
deliberate ingenuity of cruelty which almost
exceeds belief, is related, with scarcely any
variation as to circumstances, by the Advocate
General, who, as well as the gentleman of
whose estate the criminal was the manager,
and who was at the time absent, expressed
their most lively indignation against such
horrid cruelty. After so shocking a recital,
lest you should be instinctively urged to be
chiefly affected by the barbarity of this horrid
transaction, let me once more remind you,
that it is not in the view of its cruelty that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>I wish you to regard the foregoing narrative
but in that of the decisive evidence which it
affords of the utter degradation of the negro
race.</p>

<p class='c010'>How striking a proof is afforded of this, in
the conduct even of the Owner of the boy, the
prosecutor of the delinquent, a man too, as the
beginning of the story indicates “of kind and
liberal feelings.” Can any thing suggest more
strongly, that the protection which the Negro
Slave receives from the laws, is too often to be
ascribed rather to a Master’s care of his property,
than to any more generous motive.
When he had only reason to believe that <em>a</em> Negro
had been killed, and buried out of the way,
and not that it was his own Slave, he goes
away satisfied. Again, it is a suggestion
which the circumstances of the story enforce
on us, that the crowd, which was now collected,
instead of being shocked at such
barbarity, were rather abettors of it; and then
we hear, the White Savages, as the Attorney
General justly styles them, order the Negroes
who were present to dig a grave for their
wretched countryman; they knew their state
too well to refuse, and accordingly we see
them immediately obey the order; yet I
confess, that with all my ideas of their sunk
and prostrate spirit, I was myself surprized,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>under all the circumstances, by this promptitude
of obedience.</p>

<p class='c010'>But I have not leisure to deduce half of the
important lessons which we are taught by
the above horrid recital. Let us pass to the
circumstance which is most of all important;
because it proves how little we can expect
an identity of sympathies and feelings between
the Colonists and ourselves: that this and
several other murders, some of them attended
with circumstances far more shocking, instead
of exciting any just commiseration for
the Negro race, had actually worked in a
contrary direction, and that not merely among
the populace, but in a majority of the House
of Assembly itself. This is a problem by no
means of difficult solution. It is not that the
Barbadian (I say it seriously and with sincerity)
is less humane, in general, than the inhabitants
of other countries; but Negro Slaves
are not comprised within the scale of his
humanity; or, to be more accurate, they do
not assume, in his estimate of things, the
rate and value of human beings. Hence,
the proposition for punishing a white man
capitally for murdering a Slave, appeared to
him a punishment as much disproportionate
to the crime, as if, in compliance with the
opinion of some speculator on the rights of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>the brute creation, or, of some lover of domestic
animals, we were to propose to execute a
man in this country for killing a favourite
pointer.</p>

<p class='c010'>One of the other murders supplies so striking
an illustration of the nature of this feeling,
and of its almost necessary effects in
producing a disposition to injury and insult,
that, contrary to my original intention, I will
lay before you a very brief and summary view
of the chief particulars of it.</p>

<p class='c010'>As a private militiaman was returning
home from his duty upon an alarm, with
his musket, and bayonet fixed, over his shoulder,
he overtook several Negroes returning
from their daily labour on the road, and
among them, a woman big with child. He
began abusing, and threatening to kill them,
if they would not get out of the way. Most
of them escaped him; but he made after the
woman, and, without the least provocation
on her part, plunged his bayonet into her,
and, as one of the accounts states, very coolly
and deliberately stabbed her several times in
the breast. Providentially it happened, that
a very respectable Gentleman, who was also
returning from town, was a witness of the
whole transaction. And now comes the curious
<span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>part of the story; for, when Mr. H. went
to him, “spoke harshly to him, and said, he
ought to be hanged, for he never saw a
more wicked unprovoked murder, and that
he would certainly carry him before a magistrate
and that he should be sent to gaol;”
the man replied, “<em>for what? killing a Negro!</em>”—Some
of the accounts state that
the man was in liquor; but it is clear from
the circumstances, that it was in no such degree
as to affect his reason; for neither is this
circumstance mentioned by Mr. H. the eyewitness,
nor by the magistrate before whom
Mr. H., having got assistance, immediately
brought him, nor by the President of the
Island, before whom, from having no right to
commit him, they next carried him. On the
contrary, they state distinctly, that the murder
was committed in the most wanton, malicious
manner, and that he seemed afterwards
to be very indifferent about the crime.</p>

<p class='c010'>It may seem only candid to state the sequel.
The President did commit him, though
aware that it was a stretch of power; the
man’s person was thereby secured, and he
remained answerable to the amount both of
the King’s fine, £. 11. 4. <em>s.</em> sterling, and of the
Negro’s value, for which he was afterwards
arrested by the Owner’s representative, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>which, as she is stated to have been a valuable
Slave, who had five or six children, would
be a still larger sum. The man was not
worth a shilling, in possession or expectancy,
and therefore, as the President adds, may
possibly be in confinement for life. It is only
due to the President, to add, that in the conclusion
of his letter, he expresses himself in
terms of the warmest and most indignant
feeling, that the Assembly should look on
such things with cool indifference, and not
provide “that just remedy which has been
found productive of no evil in the still
larger island of Jamaica, and which, in every
other civilized community, is provided by
the law, both of God and man.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Let me subjoin one additional remark, that,
but for the circumstance of Mr. H.’s happening
to have been at the same time returning
from town, this barbarous murder must
have remained unpunished for want of evidence.
It is fair, also, to acknowledge, that
the murder above stated, however horrid, appears
(very different, indeed, in that respect,
from another shocking incident, which I suppress)
to have been an act of wanton insult
and contempt, rather than of deliberate cruelty;
and to have been precisely such in nature,
(though I doubt not, above the ordinary
<span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>rate of insults in measure) as I have supposed
to proceed from a low estimate of Negroes, as
such. Hence the criminal’s exclamation, when
he was told he deserved to be hanged, and
was further threatened with being committed
to gaol. <em>For what?</em> he replied; <em>killing a Negro!</em>—Surely
I need not add a word—the fact
supplies its own inference.</p>

<p class='c010'>Shall we allege, in behalf of this poor militiaman,
that he was, probably, half drunk;
that he was a low uneducated man; that it
was the exclamation of passion; or that it was
suggested by self-preservation or self-defence?
But what shall we say, then, for the Assembly
of the Island? They consist of men of liberal
education, and liberal manners; yet it is
grievous to reflect, that their conduct is but
too much in the same spirit as that of this
militiaman. Their estimation of a Negro is
much the same. Hence, on its being proposed
to inflict a capital punishment, not on
themselves, but on others, for the murder,
though attended with the most horrid circumstances,
of a <em>Negro</em>, they resent the suggestion,
not by a transient and passionate exclamation,
but by a deliberate and continued
opposition of some years; not unguardedly,
not privately, when a man will sometimes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>hint an opinion he would not avow; but
publicly; in opposition to clear explanation;
to powerful influence; to eloquent enforcement
of the principles of justice and humanity;
in opposition, one should have thought,
to the natural suggestion of self-interest, and
of regard to their own property, when gravely
sitting in their capacity of Legislators.</p>

<p class='c010'>Let me again, however, declare most seriously,
that it is not so much of defective, as
of misplaced humanity, that I here complain.
They had not been used to think and feel concerning
Negroes, as concerning their fellow
creatures; and to consider that their rights,
and comforts, and feelings, were to be protected
by the same powerful sanctions. Hence,
when it was proposed to inflict a capital
punishment for the murder of a Black, their
sympathy was excited on the wrong side.
They felt, but it was for the offended dignity of
a White Man, not for the murdered Negro.
The truth is, a certain <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">esprit de corps</span></i> was
now called into action, and all the barbarities
of which the wretched Negroes might be the
victims, would, in such a temper, and such
circumstances (taken, I mean, in connection
with such a proposed punishment) serve rather
to inflame than to mitigate the general fury.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>Hence, Lord Seaforth, in another letter, declares,
“that though he had received no contradiction
of the horrible facts, yet that
nothing had given him so much trouble as
to get to the bottom of these affairs, so
horribly absurd were the prejudices of the
people.”</p>

<p class='c010'>There are no persons, I am persuaded, who
will be more shocked by the above transactions
than the West Indian Proprietors themselves,
and none especially more than those
of the very island of Barbadoes, in which these
tragedies were acted. They, like other absentee
Proprietors, are most of them, I doubt not, almost
utterly ignorant of the real state of things
in the West Indies; and they will read with
equal astonishment and concern, Lord Seaforth’s
horrid communication. Let them
however remember, these cannot be styled, as
some former relations have unjustly been,
exaggerations of Abolitionists; but, like Governor
Parry’s famous charge against the
African Captains, they are the official communication
of the Executive Government laid
before the House of Commons.</p>

<p class='c010'>Let them, therefore, join with me, in seriously
considering the practical conclusions
<span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>to be drawn from these shocking incidents,
and the remedy which should be applied to
such crying evils. Let them not retort, as
has been sometimes done, that instances of
monstrous cruelty have taken place in this
country also. It is true, that even in this land
of liberty and humanity, we heard some years
ago of an apprentice being starved to death.
We heard more recently of a British Governor
of an African possession, causing the death of
a soldier by excessive punishment. But let
us complete the parallel; not only were these
crimes punished by the death of the criminals,
but here, in Lord Bacon’s phrase, “mark the
diversity;” it was difficult to prevent the indignation
even of the populace, from anticipating
the sentence of the law. In the West Indies,
on the contrary, when you begin to talk of punishing
capitally far more horrible murders, the
sympathy, among the majority of the community,
the highest classes excepted, is for the
criminal, not for the wretched and innocent
sufferer; and that, not merely among low illiterate
men, in whom such prejudices might be
somewhat less astonishing, but in the House of
Assembly of the Island, the body to which it
especially belongs to watch over the rights, and
which naturally gives the tone, and fixes the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>standard for the opinions and feelings of the
whole community.<a id='r34' /><a href='#f34' class='c011'><sup>[34]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>Let the absentee Proprietors attend, above
all, to this, because it leads to the most important
practical conclusions. I have been assured
privately, (though the information has
not yet been laid before Parliament, and
therefore I cannot speak with certainty) that
Lord Seaforth has at length been able to carry
his point, and to prevail on the Assembly as
well as the Council, to make the murder of a
Slave a capital offence. In my view of the
above transactions, this is a matter of small
importance. It will not, I trust, appear uncandid;
but I must frankly declare, that had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>the Assembly originally consented to Lord
Seaforth’s recommendation and made the
murder of a Slave a capital crime, I should
not have admitted it as any proof of their
feeling for the Negroes with any tenderness
of sensibility. It would only have shewn
that there was no apparent want of common
humanity, and therefore have belonged to that
class of actions, from the performance of
which no man arrogates to himself praise,
though to be defective in them we consider
as blameworthy. For, might we not fairly
have questioned whether the members might
not be influenced, not so much by motives of
benevolence, as by deference for their Governor,
by a regard for their character, by a
respect for the feelings, call them, if you
will, the prejudices, of the more liberal few
among their own community; or even by the
apprehensions of the effects which their refusal
might produce in forwarding the abolition of
the Slave Trade? Surely, however, the rejection
of the proposition shews, that they not
only do not themselves regard the Negroes
as entitled to the consideration and treatment
due to a <em>human being</em>, considered as such, but
that they cannot even persuade themselves
that he will be regarded as entitled to them
by the world in general.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>Supposing, therefore, that Lord Seaforth’s
law has passed, and even supposing (what it
is far too much to suppose, considering the
extreme difficulty, or rather impossibility of
obtaining legal proof, if a murderer would be
tolerably cautious) that it does prevent absolute
murders; yet how wide a range is still
left for the exercise of the worst of passions?
To this case surely we may justly apply the
maxim, and the important lesson which it
inculcates may well excuse a trite quotation,
“<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Quid leges sine moribus?</span></i>” Will such a law,
passed contrary to the real wishes, feelings,
and judgment, deliberately entertained and
repeatedly avowed for many years, change the
real estimation of a Black man in the Barbadian
scale of being? Or will not rather the
contrariety between the law and the feelings
of men, be likely to stir up a spirit of indignation
and hatred towards the Blacks, which
must be productive of innumerable injuries
and insults towards the Negro race; while,
Black evidence not being admissible, they may
be almost always injured and insulted with
impunity?</p>

<p class='c010'>This <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">esprit de corps</span></i> naturally results from
the relative circumstances of Blacks and
Whites in a West Indian community; and it
is the more operative and pernicious, because
with pride, itself a passion sufficiently regardless
<span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>of the claims and comforts of others,
another principle still more pernicious associates
itself but too naturally; a principle of
fear, arising out of the consciousness of the
immense disproportion in number between
the Blacks and the Whites. This fear again
but too surely gives rise to hatred; and
what may not be expected from the effects of
an <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">esprit de corps</span></i> made up of such powerful
ingredients? It is not that they who are
actuated by it are conscious of these several
feelings; but they are not on that account
less real or less efficient. This <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">esprit de corps</span></i>
which has long prevailed, was many years
ago nearly proving fatal to the life of a most
honourable, upright, and resolute Judge, who,
in the discharge of his public function, dared
to act as duty and conscience prescribed to
him. But among the inferior orders of Whites
especially, this spirit has been naturally called
forth of late years into more lively exercise,
by the very efforts which have been made to
ameliorate the condition of the Negro race.</p>

<p class='c010'>I have detained you very long on this topic:
but I have dwelt the more largely on the vileness
and degradation of the Negro race, because
it appears to me to be the grand master
vice of the colonial system. If duly considered,
and traced into its almost infallible
<span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>operations, it will establish the prevalence of
all the other evils which have been specified;
for it is of a nature so subtle and powerful, as
to extend its effects into every branch of negro
management; and wherever its influence
does extend, it has a natural and sure tendency
to lessen the enjoyments of the Slaves,
and to aggravate their sufferings. If all the
various other causes which operate unfavourably
on the condition and treatment of
the Slaves could be done away, it contains
within itself the pregnant source of numerous,
most important, and, so long as it continues,
incurable mischiefs.</p>

<p class='c010'>Let me, therefore, once more conjure the
West Indian Proprietors to give their due
weight to all the foregoing facts and considerations;
to observe how low a point in the
scale of being is now allotted to the Negro
race; and to estimate duly the effects on their
treatment, and comforts, and feelings, which
must necessarily result from such vileness and
degradation. I cannot quit this head without
once more assuring them, that it is unspeakably
painful to me to appear to be charging
the bulk of the resident White population of
the West Indies with having too low an estimate
of the Negroes as a race, and of the
consideration and comforts which are due to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>them. But the nature of my undertaking
renders it my duty to state facts, such as I
really believe them to be. If I have fallen
into any error, I shall be most willing to correct
it, and shall be sincerely thankful to any
one who will set me right. But I will frankly
own, also, to the resident West Indians, that,
judged at the bar of equity and candour, we
in this country are more in fault than they
in that. Of them it can only be said, that
causes of powerful, and, where great numbers
of human beings are concerned, of almost infallible
operation, have produced their natural
effects. We have no such excuse to allege.
We have not been familiarized by habit, or
misled by interest, or prejudice, or party
spirit, into contemplating without pain, a
system from which, at first, both they and we
must have shrunk back with horror. We
cannot allege, that all the consequences,
greatly as they are to be deplored, are not
such as we might have anticipated with ease,
or rather might have predicted with certainty,
reasoning from the acknowledged
principles both of speculation and experience.
Could we not have foretold what
would necessarily be the consequences of a
system of slavery continued for centuries,
where the Slaves, as in the West Indies,
were to be of a peculiar race and colour, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>under all the other circumstances of the African
Negroes? We cannot, at least, plead a prejudice
in favour of slavery, in consequence
of having long been habituated to its evils.
Surely if those who have lived all their lives
in Great Britain, are tainted with such a prejudice,
they are of all men inexcusable. I repeat
it, therefore, we are more criminal than
the West Indians, for having suffered such
a system to gain an establishment, and to
grow to its present size; and we shall be still
a thousand times more criminal than they, if,
with our eyes at length opened to its evils,
we suffer it to continue unreformed.</p>

<p class='c010'>But though from these considerations, as well
as others which have been formerly mentioned,
it has been with deep reluctance that I have
dwelt on these invidious topics, would it
be consistent not only with humanity and
justice, but even with common fairness and
truth, that transactions like those which have
been here stated, when communicated from
the highest authority; and, for the instruction
and guidance of the British Legislature,
laid before the House of Commons, should
be suppressed, from any motives of personal
delicacy; or if noticed, that just conclusions
should not be drawn from them? I am almost
fearful that I am wanting to the claims
of duty, in not detailing the particulars of a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>far more horrible narrative, which has also
been laid before Parliament. For duties too
serious, and even interests too high, for the
admission of such an inferior principle as
delicacy, are here in question. If such a
system must still exist, surely it ought only
to be with our fullest knowledge, the result
of our most deliberate consideration; not
because we are unacquainted with its horrors,
from our having instinctively turned
away our eyes from objects too painful to be
beheld.</p>

<p class='c010'>Consider if these enormities are too shocking
to be seen and heard, what are they to
be felt and suffered? When we are thoroughly
acquainted with the abuses of the
West Indian system, we may, perhaps, be
able to mitigate, if we cannot cure them.
If policy and interest are still to be admitted
as a plea for injustice and cruelty, let us at
least not take for granted, as if it were a self-evident
truth, what I never can myself believe,
that injustice and cruelty must forward
the views of policy and interest.  Let us
scrutinize the evils point by point, and be
sure of each individual particular of them
which we leave in being, that on grounds of
policy and interest it is indispensable. If we
are to tolerate such enormous evils, let it be
at least by weight and measure; let us deal
<span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span>them out, grain by grain, as absolute necessity
shall require; and not in a wholesale way,
give our sanction to such a mass of miseries,
because the close inspection and scrupulous
examination of them shock our delicacy, and
wound our humanity. Let us remember
what was beautifully said of this last virtue by
one, than whom none possessed a larger share;
“True humanity consists not in a squeamish
ear. It consists not in starting or shrinking
at such tales as these, but in a disposition
of heart to relieve misery. True humanity
appertains rather to the mind than to the
nerves, and prompts men to use real and
active endeavours to execute the actions
which it suggests.”</p>

<p class='c010'>To this long catalogue of the vices of the
West Indian system, there remain yet to be
added two others, which tend powerfully to
aggravate almost all its various evils.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Absenteeship.</div>

<p class='c010'>The first is, Absenteeship, particularly
of the more affluent Proprietor, who
could afford to be liberal, whose presence
among his Slaves would naturally produce a
sort of parental feeling, and cause him habitually
to interest himself in their comfort and
improvement; and whose affluence might enable
him to carry into effect the plans, whether
<span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>in the way of exemption or beneficence,
which his liberality should devise.</p>

<p class='c010'>I have not leisure to point out in detail the
various bad consequences which follow from
the Owner’s absence; but they will naturally
occur to any one who will consider the peculiar
circumstances of the West Indian Slaves,
in connection with this subject.</p>

<p class='c010'>But let me point out one consequence which
has been less attended to than it deserves to
be, the unspeakable loss to the society, of that
very class of men, not only in the legislature,
but in private life also, who, from their rank
and fortune, must in general be supposed to
have received the best education, and to possess
the most enlarged and liberal minds;
who consequently would raise the general
standard of morals and manners, whose presence,
and the desire of being admitted into
whose company, would be a check to dissoluteness;
who would not only abound themselves
in acts of kindness to the wretched Negroes,
but who might make liberality popular, and
render, more than it now is, the ill-treatment
of Negroes disreputable; for I trust it is already
so in no small degree, where it is discovered.
Many absentee Proprietors, of large
property, even if they do, once or twice in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>their lives, visit their estates; yet, while
living in the West Indies, they consider themselves
not at home, but only on a visit, and
on a visit commonly which is not very agreeable
to them, and which, therefore, especially
when, as often is the case, constrained by
œconomical motives, they mean to end, as
soon as they have saved enough to enable
them to live again in the mother country in
ease and affluence. Hence they are too naturally
persuaded to adopt the generally prevailing
practice as to feeding and clothing,
and other particulars; and, however desirous
they may be of introducing a more liberal system,
they are easily dissuaded from it, knowing
that they shall not be able themselves to
superintend the actual observance of their own
regulations.</p>

<p class='c010'>As for the far larger class of absentee Proprietors,
who reside constantly in the mother
country, though I give them all due credit
for benevolent intentions, yet they are commonly
precluded by their very ignorance of
plantation affairs, from interfering with any
confidence, or to any good purpose, in the
detail of management. How little they are
often acquainted with these particulars, I was
not even myself aware till lately, when it appeared,
that an old West Indian Proprietor,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span>acknowledged by all who know him to be
remarkable for the extent and accuracy of his
information, and intimately conversant with
all the detail of political and commercial œconomy,
was wholly ignorant of its being the
universal practice to work the Negroes in their
field-work under the whip. This is the more
remarkable, because the practice is not a partial
or an occasional procedure, but the constant
and universal mode; because for several
years, men in general in this country, though
personally unconnected with the West Indies,
had been naturally led to turn their attention
to the system of negro management.</p>

<p class='c010'>I doubt not that the absentee Proprietor
directs his manager to treat the Slaves with
all due kindness and liberality; yet it must not
be conceded with equal readiness, that the
orders even of these benevolent Absentees will
be faithfully executed. For in supposing this
to be the case, we suppose a combination of
incidents, and an assemblage of qualities,
each of which, unconnected with the others,
is sufficiently rare; how much more rare,
then, must it be, to suppose them all concurring.
We must suppose this benevolent
Absentee to be affluent also, that he may be
able to give effect to his benevolence. Benevolence,
I trust and believe, will generally be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>found in the higher class of Proprietors; but
I fear affluence, in proportion to their rank
and way of living, is not so common. Again,
we have also to suppose the more rare occurrence,
not merely of equal but of far superior
benevolence, in a man of inferior rank, fortune,
connections, and manners, most probably
of inferior education also. We must
suppose this man of extraordinary benevolence
to select for himself the situation of a manager
in the West Indies, a somewhat unlikely
choice; and that this benevolent owner, and
this still more benevolent manager, happen to
come together; I repeat it, still more benevolent,
because this quality in the owner,
though a generous, is a transient effusion,
when the mind is in close contact with its
object; or we may assign to it the higher
character, of the habitual generosity of a just
judgment, and a liberal heart. But such a
judgment and such a feeling may often be
found in a moment of serious reflection, in
men, who from various infirmities, are not
practically kind and beneficent in all the
homely occurrences of daily life; especially
under circumstances in which there are many
little trials to be borne, and many vexatious
obstacles to be surmounted.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>But we are to suppose a manager whose
benevolence is of this hardier and firmer
kind. It must be a principle ever wakeful
and observant; combined with judgment,
and improved by experience; the very acquisition
of which experience implies the having
been long practically conversant with the
system. We must suppose also, what is very
extraordinary, that this long familiarity with
prevailing abuses has not, in any degree, impaired
the power to perceive, or the promptitude
to redress them. In short, we are to
suppose a principle so vigorous as to resist
the strongest counteractions, and not only to
maintain its existence, but to support a continued
activity, under circumstances the most
powerfully calculated to impair and destroy it.</p>

<p class='c010'>But we have not yet done. Besides this
extraordinary portion of benevolence, this
rare manager must have some other qualities
not less uncommon. He must not only have
the firmness to dare to be singular, and to expose
himself to the imputation of wishing to
be thought to have more humanity than his
neighbours, a sort of courage the most difficult
of all to be found in our days; but, above
all, he must resist the consciousness, that in
return for all his humane exertions he may
be misrepresented to his employer; that,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>having acquired the character of a visionary
schemer, who sends home comparatively
small returns, and calls for great expences,
he may, in consequence of such representations,
be dismissed from his present office,
and in vain solicit another. To find such a
man, of so much benevolence, combined with
so much resolute integrity, must be acknowledged
to be no common occurrence. That
such a man should be in the precise situation
of overseer of a West Indian estate we should
still less expect; and that this rare manager
should meet with this more than commonly
benevolent owner, is a still more curious coincidence.
Yet all these expectations must be
realized, for an Absentee’s plantation to be
regulated as it ought to be, under the present
circumstances of the West Indies.</p>

<p class='c010'>This subject is of such primary practical
importance, that I must still be permitted to
add one word more. Any man who will
consider what his own feelings and temptations
would be likely to be, were he the absentee
Proprietor of a West Indian estate,
will acknowledge the force of my reasoning;
and they who may see no reason to suspect
themselves, will be precisely those, concerning
whom all other men would be apt to
entertain the strongest suspicions. Were we
<span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>ourselves West Indian proprietors, we naturally should wish that the income of our estate might be as large, and the outgoings as small
as might be; and though in a benevolent, or
rather let me call it, a just mind, this wish
would be qualified by the understood condition,
that the Slaves should be sufficiently
provided for; yet, ever allowing most honourable
exceptions to the contrary, that
which would in general constitute a manager’s
recommendation, which would obtain
him a character, would be his increasing the
clear profits of the estate. All this depends
on principles of universal, infallible, and constant
operation. It was the case in Mr.
Long’s time. He pointed out to the West
Indian Proprietors, in the strongest terms, the
mischief done by “overseers,<a id='r35' /><a href='#f35' class='c011'><sup>[35]</sup></a> whose chief
aim it was to raise to themselves a character
as able planters, by increasing the
produce of the respective estates; this is
too frequently attempted, by forcing the
Negroes to labour beyond their abilities;
of course, they drop off, and if not recruited
incessantly, the gentleman steals
away, like a rat from a barn in flames, and
carries the credit of great plantership, and
vast crops in his hand, to obtain advanced
<span class='pageno' id='Page_185'>185</span>wages from some new employer in another district of the island. The Absentees are too often deceived, who measure the condition
of their properties by the large remittances
sent to them for one or two
years, without adverting to the heavy losses
sustained in the production of them.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Let me likewise again remind the benevolent
absentee Proprietor to beware lest he is
misled by the ambiguities of language. Let
him bear in mind that when he receives from
his manager in the West Indies, assurances
that his Negroes have <em>sufficient</em> supply of food,
and clothing, and medical care; that their
work is not <em>unduly</em> hard, nor their treatment
<em>unduly</em> rigorous; that <em>sufficient</em> regard is paid
to their comforts, and their feelings: Let me
again remind him, that this <em>sufficiency</em> is not
necessarily estimated by the measure of the
claims and wants and feelings of a human
being. Of course, I mean to speak only of
managers in general. Individuals there are
of that class, I doubt not, of a liberality and
feeling, which would do honour to any
rank. But it must be remembered, that it
would be unreasonable to expect them to be
exempt from prejudices and feelings, to which
they are peculiarly exposed, and which have
been so lately proved to prevail in the majority
<span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>of a body of men like the Assembly of Barbadoes,
greatly superior to them in rank, connections,
and fortune. If such a prejudice could
shew itself also, and exert its influence in the
sight of the world, and in the face of so many
opposing considerations, how much more must
it not be expected to operate, when there is no
bystander to witness its acts, and when indolence,
self-interest, habit, example, and various
other motives, conspire to give effect to it?</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Effect of the pressure of the times.</div>

<p class='c010'>But if, in the way which has been lately
stated, the Slaves suffered from absenteeship
thirty or forty years ago, for it is so long
since Mr. Long remarked the evil, how much
must their sufferings have been aggravated
in our days, when (this is the second circumstance
to which I alluded some time ago)
the increased extravagance of the age on
the one hand, and the increased price of all
articles of consumption on the other, furnish
to every man, strong additional inducements
for raising his estate to its utmost value?
Above all, how powerfully must this principle
operate in the case of those whose estates
are considerably encumbered with debts? And
this, remember, is actually the case of probably
nine tenths of all West Indian Proprietors.
Here in truth consists the grand obstacle in
the way of all those regulations, in the present
<span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>system, which would call for any additional
expenditure in the first instance. Proprietors,
whose estates, after paying the interest
of their mortgages, leave scarcely enough,
in our times of pecuniary difficulty and pressure,
for merely decent subsistence, much less sufficient
to live upon in the way naturally acceptable
to the West Indians, who are, in general,
men of liberal and hospitable habits; such Proprietors,
so circumstanced, must naturally be
endeavouring in every instance to discover the
minimum of charge, and the maximum of
production. The manager of the estate will
not be long in learning this, and his endeavours
will be directed to the same objects.
The effects of lessening the allowances of the
Slaves may not be immediately visible, and
he may really conceive that, without injury to
them, somewhat may be saved for the master.
But I will not pursue this invidious topic into
its too obvious consequences. The professional
Planter has just sketched a faint outline
of some of the effects.<a id='r36' /><a href='#f36' class='c011'><sup>[36]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span>Let me, however, remind all Proprietors
who are thus circumstanced, that however
inconvenient it may be to them, to increase,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>for a time, the outgoings, and subtract from
the receipts of their estate, to go on as they
are now doing, is sure and utter ruin. Will
they say, that the course which I recommend,
however politic ultimately, yet at the moment,
and in their circumstances, deserves no
better a name? I must reply, the professional
<span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>Planter will tell them, that the opposite system
of working down their gangs of Negroes,
and making them good from the Slave market,
is murder added to ruin, murder too in its most
painful and shocking, because a protracted
form.</p>

<p class='c010'>The topic on which I have just now
touched, so lightly, considering its importance,
reminds me of another circumstance, which,
in various ways, has a most unfavourable tendency
on the treatment and happiness of the
Slaves; and which, though it has operated
powerfully in the West Indies, has never,
perhaps, produced such extensive effects as
within the last twenty or thirty years. This
is, the buying of West Indian property on
speculation. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>West Indian speculations injurious to the Slaves.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> Wherever this is the principle of purchase, it is for the most part connected
with the formation of new settlements, and
this is in various ways, some of which have
been already specified, productive of unspeakable
misery to the Negroes employed in forming
them.</p>

<p class='c010'>But besides this probable class of evils,
where any one is engaged in planting speculations,
there must naturally be a disposition
to regard the undertaking as a mercantile
transaction, in which the investiture of capital
<span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span>is to be made as small, and the returns as
large as possible; rather than as a landed
property, or as (for that is the light in which
a West Indian estate ought still more to be considered)
as a little sovereignty of a feudal nature,
the vassals of which have a claim to their
lord’s protection, with whom, therefore, he
is instituting a connection of mutual duties,
services, and attachments, which is to subsist
on both sides through generations yet unborn.</p>

<p class='c010'>I scarcely need state, that, most commonly,
West Indian speculations fail; and in that
failure, at whatever number of years it happens,
is most probably involved the sale of
such of the Slaves as survive, to a new owner.
But I must forbear from enlarging on this
important topic, and hurry you through
what remains of our painful journey. It is a
course furnishing, at every moment, numerous
and interesting objects: But in the case
of the greater part of them, I must be forced
to content myself with doing little more than
barely pointing them out for your own more
deliberate consideration. Other duties now
demand my time, and I should be strongly
tempted to desist from my undertaking, from
the consciousness that in such a brief and
hasty progress, I cannot do justice to the great
<span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>interests which are at stake, if I were not
deeply impressed with a sense of the importance
of stating at this time, though but imperfectly,
the real views and principles of
the Abolitionists.</p>

<p class='c010'>To resume my subject. I have now stated
the chief vices of the present West Indian system.
But before I quit the discussion concerning
West Indian abuses, <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Admirals and other most respectable witnesses gave evidence of the good treatment of Slaves.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> I might appear wanting in justice to the cause, and even in deference
towards many gentlemen of high respectability,
if I were not to acknowledge, that the
condition and treatment of the Negro Slaves
were painted in colours which were almost a
direct contrast to all which have been here
used, by several West Indian Proprietors of
great consideration and affluence; and still
more by several persons of high rank,
who resided for some time in the West
Indies, either in a naval and military capacity,
or, in some few instances, as governors
of islands.</p>

<p class='c010'>It is no disparagement to the characters of
these justly respected men, to affirm, that this
was not the stage which they trod to the most
advantage. It is due to them however, to
say, in general, that they came forward from
the impulse of grateful and generous feelings.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_193'>193</span>While in the West Indies, they had been treated
with that liberality and kindness which
strangers never fail to experience in those hospitable
islands. If they visited a country
plantation, it was commonly on a scheme of
pleasure; every countenance around them
was lighted up with cheerfulness and gaiety;
they themselves naturally partook of the same
feelings, and looked on every object with a
good-humoured eye.</p>

<p class='c010'>But even when a longer residence afforded
more ample means of acquiring information,
they looked down from an elevation far too
high to allow of their having a just perception
of the state and circumstances of the
poor depressed Negro Slaves. It will not, I
trust, be deemed disrespectful treatment of
men, towards whom, in common with their
countrymen, in general, I feel great respect
and gratitude, to say, that they came forward
under the influence of strong prejudices.
And who needs be told of the wonder-working
powers of prejudice, in colouring,
adding to, or subtracting from the scene
which it contemplates? What can render
this more apparent, than that they had come
to a conclusion, without touching on the
premises on which it must depend. They
expressed a decided opinion, that the abolition
<span class='pageno' id='Page_194'>194</span>must ruin the Colonies; an opinion
which, it is obvious, must necessarily depend
on the practicability of keeping up, or
increasing, the stock of Slaves; and yet on the
latter point they had formed no opinion. In
others of their statements, the effects of prejudice
were not less visible.</p>

<p class='c010'>In truth, it scarcely needs be remarked, that
these respectable visitors could know very
little of the general treatment of the Negroes,
of their allowance of food, and ordinary
amount of labour, and still less of the temper
and disposition of the manager, on which so
much must depend. If he were ever so severe,
or even ever so cruel, the visit of an Admiral
would not be his time for shewing these dispositions.
In short, these gentlemen appeared
almost utterly unacquainted with those details,
an accurate knowledge of which would
alone warrant the opinions which they delivered.
Such are the conclusions which we
should naturally form, from a general knowledge
of the circumstances of the case.</p>

<p class='c010'>But, added to all these, we fortunately
obtained access to one of the party, a West
Indian gentleman, who resided many years
in Jamaica; whose high respectability and
ample fortune had not so estranged him from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_195'>195</span>the poor despised Negroes, as to prevent his
seeing, and pitying their distresses; and who,
with a resolute benevolence and integrity,
rarely found in these days, dared to come
forward and deliver his evidence in behalf of
that injured race.</p>

<p class='c010'>He declared that he had often accompanied
Governors and Admirals in their visits to the
different plantations. That the estates naturally
being those of persons of distinction, were
such as must be supposed to be under the best
management; and that all possible care would
be taken to keep every disgusting object out
of sight, that the feelings of those high personages
might not be wounded.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Opponents witnesses: Effects of Selection.</div>

<p class='c010'>There is also a remark which must be
made, concerning the evidence of several very
respectable West Indian Proprietors, who appeared
as witnesses. The West Indian body,
it is obvious, would naturally look through
the whole range of Proprietors, and call as
witnesses those whom they knew to be most
affluent and humane. But nothing can possibly
be so unreasonable as to suppose, that
we are hereby furnished with any fair sample
of the general treatment of the Negroes,
which, as has been already stated, must necessarily
vary according to the temper and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_196'>196</span>disposition of the owner (and also of their manager,)
and still more than on his temper, on his
being in affluent or distressed circumstances,
on the nature of his views and undertakings.
But from this selection of witnesses, which
however was perfectly natural, the treatment
and the allowances of some peculiarly liberal
and affluent proprietors are taken as the treatment
and allowances of all masters, in all their
several varieties. Indeed, these witnesses themselves
were disposed to take for granted, and
thence to state, that their own was the general
mode of proceeding, partly from the natural
repugnance which is felt by men of liberal
minds to say any thing which might have the
appearance of boasting of their own peculiar
liberality; partly, from the real ignorance
of one man as to the conduct of another, in
all matters of private management.</p>

<p class='c010'>It would, however, be gross injustice to
my cause, not to mention one instance, in
which the effect of this mode of proceeding,
in conveying, quite unintentionally I doubt
not, a very exaggerated idea of the allowances
and comforts of Slaves, was established by
indisputable proof.<a id='r37' /><a href='#f37' class='c011'><sup>[37]</sup></a> The Agent for the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_197'>197</span>Island of Jamaica, a gentleman truly respectable
and well-informed, with some other
coadjutors of equal respectability, when questioned
by the Privy Council as to the provisions
allowed to the Slaves, stated; that the
common allowance of herrings, which are
used for the Slaves as a seasoning of their
vegetable food, was from twenty to twenty-five
barrels of herrings annually, to every one
hundred Slaves. Now, taking an average of
five years of peace immediately after a long
war, from 1783 to 1787, the whole number
of Slaves in the island being estimated at
about 230,000, and the field Slaves, according
to the usual calculation, as seven-eighths
of the whole number, the barrels of herrings
consumed ought to have been near 46,000
barrels. But the accounts of imports shew,
that the average quantity of herrings, and
all other cured fish, annually imported during
the five years, not for the Negroes alone, but
for all the inhabitants of the island, amounted
to not half the quantity, to but 21,089 barrels.
Surely this circumstance powerfully
confirms the supposition, which, on our reasoning
from what we know of the manner of
selecting and bringing forward witnesses,
would be suggested to our minds.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_198'>198</span>It is curious likewise to observe concerning
both those most respectable witnesses who
were formerly mentioned, and concerning
several justly respected members of the West
Indian body who delivered their testimony,
that their evidence covers a considerable
extent both of time and space, and yet they
make no distinction whatever as to periods
and places. In every island, equally, during
the whole period of their acquaintance with
the West Indies, the Slaves were treated as
well as possible. Now the West Indians themselves
tell us, that the treatment of Negroes
has been exceedingly improved within the last
twenty or thirty years: if this be so, there
were at least defects in the system formerly;
yet in speaking of that former period,
no such hint is given; but the treatment is
stated to have been uniformly excellent.
These declarations are manifestly incompatible.</p>

<p class='c010'>The question itself, whether the treatment
has or has not improved of late years, is of
great importance; but far too large and
difficult to be here discussed. Still, as the
assertion is often made, and as, in the opinion
of some, it may be of great practical influence,
a few words ought to be said on it. That
there are fewer individual instances of cruelty
<span class='pageno' id='Page_199'>199</span>now than formerly, I believe to be true. It
is alleged, and I hope truly, that an improvement
has taken place in the education and
manners of the book-keepers, or overseers,
who are in immediate and continual contact
with the Slaves; and whose characters and
tempers must therefore have a decisive effect
one way or another on the treatment they
receive. But the system continues the same;
and it is greatly to be feared that the increasing
pressure of the times has tended in
too many instances to abridge the stock, before
but too contracted, of the Slave’s comforts,
and perhaps to increase his labours.</p>

<p class='c010'>It is worthy also of remark, that the West
Indian colonies, and their inhabitants, are
almost always mentioned, by the witnesses
before mentioned, in general terms; and
scarcely a hint is given us, that greater attention
is paid to the comforts and feelings of
the Slaves in one island, than in another.
Now in the case of one island, and that next
to Jamaica, by far the largest and most populous
of them all, we have had such proof,
I had almost used Shakespeare’s expression,
such damning proof, of the low estimate of
Negroes, and of the treatment to which they
are liable, as even our opponents themselves
must own to be utterly inconsistent with the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_200'>200</span>accounts of those respectable witnesses of
whom I have before spoken. And indeed in
others of the islands we have the same facts
established by individual testimony of the
most respectable sort. Are we not, then,
entitled to extend the application of the instances,
and to consider them, such as indeed
from their number also they must be regarded,
as fair samples, by no means of the universal,
but of the general condition and treatment of
the negro Slaves?</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Assertion, that Negro Slaves are happier than our Peasantry.</div>

<p class='c010'>But another broad and general objection
may be urged against the testimony of the
same respectable class of witnesses, that it
proves by far too much. For they tell us
not only that the Slaves are in general treated
with liberality and kindness; not only that
they are protected by law equally with white
men, in their lives and property; but that
they are in a situation superior to that of the
bulk of our English peasantry: and one most
respectable and amiable man, of whose humanity
no one thinks more highly than myself,
declared, that they were so happy that
he often wished himself one of them.</p>

<p class='c010'>Such assertions as these might excite a
smile, if the subject were less serious; but
after the review we have taken of the degraded
<span class='pageno' id='Page_201'>201</span>state of this unfortunate class of our
fellow creatures, in all its humiliating particulars,
we cannot but hear, with the greatest
pain, assertions, which, coming from characters
so respectable, have but too manifest a
tendency to prolong the duration of those
enormous evils. The assertions can in themselves
be only accounted for by the supposition,
that they who made them were utterly
ignorant of the particulars of the treatment
and estimation of the Negro race. They may
have seen, perhaps, the domestic Negroes
collected at some season of festivity, and
thence have too hastily drawn an inference
as to the general situation of the bulk of the
Black population; of that far larger class,
which daily works under the whip, and is
subject to all the other particulars which
have been mentioned, of degradation and
suffering.</p>

<p class='c010'>When from the West Indies themselves I
have heard the same assertion, that the negro
Slaves are happier than our labouring poor, let
me be forgiven for declaring, that such an
opinion, formed not by transient visitors, but
by those to whom a Negro sale, working
under the whip, public and severe floggings
of decent females, private punishments, and
all the other sad particulars of negro humiliation
<span class='pageno' id='Page_202'>202</span>are thoroughly known, has, I own,
created in my mind a reflection of a different
character. I have by no means questioned
the veracity of those from whom the remark
has fallen, or imputed to them, I say it with
sincerity, the smallest intention to deceive;
but I have conceived myself to see in it an
instance of that righteous ordination of the
Almighty, by which it ever happens, that the
system of slavery, and the same may be affirmed
of every other gross infringement on the
rights and happiness of our fellow creatures,
is far from being so much clear gain, even to
those for whose exclusive advantage it may
appear to be instituted. It is not by the
wretched Negro that the whole price is to be
paid. Surely it is much, that the Master’s
understanding of the nature and amount of
the value of liberty is so far impaired. Much
also is paid in that effect which, ever since the
world began, has ever been produced by slavery
on both the morals and manners of the
free part of the community in which it has
prevailed.</p>

<p class='c010'>It would be really an insult to the understandings
and feelings of members of
this free and happy country, to enter into any
detailed comparison between the situation of
a British peasant and a West Indian Slave.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_203'>203</span>It is almost in every particular a perfect contrast;
and, for my own part, when, after
asserting, with what correctness we will not
just now question, that the Slaves are better
fed, and clothed, and lodged, than our own
peasantry; and when the conclusion has been
so confidently drawn, that therefore they must
be happier; the assertion has appeared to me
to supply only another proof, in addition to the
many already furnished, that our opponents in
their judgments as well as in their feelings are
apt to reason concerning the Negroes, as well
as to act towards them, as if they were of an inferior
species. Were we engaged in any inquiry
concerning the brute creation, to ascertain
these particulars might be to decide the question
of their happiness or misery. But are
feeding and clothing, and lodging, the only
claims of a rational and immortal Being?
Are the feelings of the heart nothing? Are
the consciousness of independence, and the
power of pursuing the occupation and habits
of life which we prefer, nothing? Is the prospect
of happier days, and of an improved
situation for ourselves or our children, nothing?
Where also are family endearments,
and social intercourse, and willing services,
and grateful returns? Where, above all, are
moral improvement, and the light of religious
truth, and the hope full of immortality?</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span>It is indeed a merciful ordination of the
Supreme Being, that men are often able to
accommodate themselves in some degree to
their situation, and to suffer less from it than
we might suppose. We may therefore sometimes
be apt to imagine our fellow creatures
more miserable than they really are, because
we should be extremely miserable in their
situation; but this does not alter the essential
nature of things, and annihilate the distinctions
between happiness and misery.</p>

<p class='c010'>But besides that in the negro Slave’s condition
there are but too many glaring unambiguous
causes of positive suffering, many of
those sources of enjoyment which are commonly
open to the poor and the ignorant, are
here excluded. It has justly been observed, as
an instance of the goodness of the great Creator
of all things, that though he has provided
the world with but a scanty portion of those
more curious substances, or more refined luxuries,
which are never necessary to happiness,
and which often serve only to gratify vanity;
the articles which are really necessary for the
comfort and well-being of man, are either
supplied every where with inexhaustible profusion,
or are at least of no difficult attainment.
By a like gracious ordination, he has
likewise rendered the enjoyments which are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_205'>205</span>most substantially and permanently gratifying,
universally accessible; the domestic affections,
the social pleasures, the tender emotions,
the sweets of hope, and recollection,
religious hopes and consolations. All these
are gratifications which virtuous poverty often
enjoys in large measure, which wealth cannot
purchase, nor greatness secure.</p>

<p class='c010'>But in the Negro’s cup few indeed of these
cordial drops are to be found; while there
are too many other ingredients which even to
a negro palate must be unconquerably bitter.
We are not, however, here left to infer their
actual feelings, from considering what our
own would be in their situation. We learn,
from the professional Planter, how their spirits
sink within them on their first acquaintance
with the cart-whip system, and with what
caution a provident manager will inure them
to the discipline and treatment to which they
are hereafter to be subjected. We have heard
from others, of negro mothers lamenting the
wretched prospect of their offspring.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Decisive proof that Slaves state unhappy.</div>

<p class='c010'>But there is one decisive proof, that even
custom does not render the Slaves insensible
to the evils of their condition. It sometimes
happens, rarely if ever I am assured to common
field Slaves, but sometimes to domestics
<span class='pageno' id='Page_206'>206</span>and artificers, that by the sale of the little
productions and stock which they are allowed
to raise, they may annually lay by a little
peculium, which, it is due to the masters to
declare, is never invaded. When the savings
of many years have, at length, accumulated
to a considerable amount, how do they dispose
of it? With this sum, for which they
have been struggling during the whole course
of their lives, they go to their masters, and
buy their freedom. By the sacrifice of their
last shilling, they purchase their release from
that situation which the West Indians would
persuade us is a condition of superior comfort.
Or, if they think that the little which
is left of their own lives is not worth redeeming,
they will purchase the freedom of a son,
or a brother, or a sister; thus affording at
once a proof of the value they set on freedom,
and of their disinterestedness and social
affection.</p>

<p class='c010'>It ought likewise to be observed, that they
who thus buy their freedom, are likely, from
the habits of industry which the very circumstance
of their acquiring so much property
implies them to have had, to have
smarted less than the general mass of
Slaves under the whip of the driver. And
what is it that they thus purchase at so high
<span class='pageno' id='Page_207'>207</span>a rate? Is it really freedom? The consideration,
the security, equal rights, equal laws,
and all the other blessings which the word
liberty conveys to our minds? No: but degradation
and insecurity; the admission into
a class of beings whose inadequate protection,
by the law and the public force of the community,
is not in some measure compensated
by the interest which their owner feels in the
preservation of his property. They are still
of the inferior cast, and must for ever continue
of it—a set of beings, as Mr. Edwards
himself informs us, “wretched in themselves
and useless to the Public. These unhappy
people are a burthen and a reproach to society.
It very frequently happens that the
lowest white person, considering himself as
greatly superior to the richest and best
educated free man of colour, will disdain to
associate with a person of the latter description.”<a id='r38' /><a href='#f38' class='c011'><sup>[38]</sup></a>
“No wonder that, as it is added,
their spirits seem to sink under the consciousness
of their condition. They are continually
liable to be injured and insulted with
impunity, from the inadmissibility of their
evidence; so that in this respect they seem
to be placed on a worse footing than the
enslaved Negroes, who have masters that
are interested in their protection, and who,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_208'>208</span>if their Slaves are maltreated, have a right
to recover damages by an action on the
case.”<a id='r39' /><a href='#f39' class='c011'><sup>[39]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>Yet this wretched and degraded state, the
lowest, one would have conceived, and least
desirable, of all human conditions, is eagerly
coveted, is bought with the earnings of a
whole life, by the Negro Slave. And shall we
then be told that the situation of the latter
is a situation of comfort, a situation superior
to that of our British peasantry! Nor is it
merely that the Slaves themselves desire their
freedom, over-rating perhaps the evils of
their actual state, and ignorant of what may
be really conducive to their happiness. I
would not so calumniate the West Indians,
as to impute to them that they mock these
poor people with a real evil, under the name
of an imaginary good; yet we find masters
remunerating long and faithful services by the
gift of freedom, as their best reward; nay,
more, we have seen the laws of the islands
hold out the same boon as the most valuable
recompence of the most distinguished public
merits.</p>

<p class='c010'>I cannot therefore but consider the earnestness
of the Slaves to purchase, at so dear a
rate, their admission into a class of beings,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_209'>209</span>which, whether we judge from what we know
of the circumstances of their situation, or
from the accounts given of it by all intelligent
writers (by none more than by Mr. Edwards
himself), we should conceive the most unprotected,
ineligible and miserable condition of
human existence in any civilized society, as
a most decisive proof of the wretchedness of
the state of slavery. From the very nature
of the case, it is probable, in some of the
instances, we know, that they who have thus
purchased their freedom have been the Slaves
of Masters of affluence, under whom the
treatment must have been as mild and liberal,
and the situation as comfortable, as the condition
of a West Indian Slave is capable of
being rendered. It therefore seems fairly to
indicate that there are particulars in the situation
and circumstances of a West Indian Slave
in general, as such, which prove a source of
great practical suffering; and perhaps it is a
proof of the degree in which the Slaves are
conscious of their own degradation. But it
also well deserves to be noted, that we never
find any, either of those Slaves who have
bought their freedom, or of the free Negroes
or coloured men, of whom there are above a
thousand in many of the smaller islands, and
in Jamaica several thousands, desiring to be
again admitted into the condition of slavery.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_210'>210</span>We know that in the middle ages it was
not uncommon for poor men of free condition
voluntarily to become vassals, that, in an age
in which person and property were very imperfectly
secure, they might obtain a master’s
protection; but the vassalage of the middle
ages was not the slavery of the West Indies.
In spite of all the evils therefore and degradation,
incident to the state of Blacks who
have no owner to protect them from injuries
and insults, there never yet was, surely there
never will be, an instance of an emancipated
Negro returning to resume the yoke of slavery,
notwithstanding all the security and all the
comforts which we are assured this situation
carries in its train. May not also the state
and circumstances of this class account for the
numerous defects and vices which are laid to
their charge? Their indolence is particularly
noticed, and their never engaging in field-work
is mentioned as discreditable to them:
but can we wonder that none will subject
themselves to the driver’s lash, who are not
absolutely forced to submit to such a degradation.<a id='r40' /><a href='#f40' class='c011'><sup>[40]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_211'>211</span>On the whole, therefore, notwithstanding
the favourable representation made of
the condition and treatment of the negro
Slaves by persons of high rank and acknowledged
respectability; if you will seriously
weigh the amount of the various vices of
the West Indian system which have been
here enumerated, you will be ready almost
with certainty to conclude; that, under circumstances
so extremely unfavourable to the
multiplication of our species, the West Indian
Slaves must annually and rapidly decrease in
number. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>First Proposition proved.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> This, it will be remembered, was the first of the three propositions which I undertook
to prove on the question concerning
the keeping up of the Black population without
importations from Africa.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Second Proposition.</div>

<p class='c010'>The second proposition was, that notwithstanding
all the grievous abuses of the West
Indian system, the decrease of the Slaves was
on the whole very inconsiderable, if there
were any decrease at all.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_212'>212</span>When the Slave Trade became first the subject
of public discussion, His Majesty’s ministers
sent to the legislative and executive bodies of
the different West Indian Islands, a number
of queries, the answers to which contained a
vast body of information on the various particulars
of the colonial system. A great addition
was made to this stock of information,
by examining various persons of intelligence
and experience in West Indian affairs. The
whole was compiled into one bulky Report,
and laid before both Houses of Parliament.</p>

<p class='c010'>This Report contains the account of the
population, both white and black, slave and
free, of our several West Indian islands, as received
from their respective governors. We are
there furnished with the actually existing number
of the Slaves in Jamaica, <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Jamaica Slaves Population.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> which alone contained as many as all the other islands put
together, at several different periods; the first,
at the distance of almost a century; the last,
in the year 1787; together with the number
of Slaves imported annually, during the whole
period. In order to judge whether the Black
population was in an improving or declining
state, the whole term was divided into four
periods:</p>

<table class='table1' summary=''>

    <td class='c013'>1787.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_213'>213</span>And we had the satisfaction to find, from those
unexceptionable documents, that,</p>

<table class='table1' summary=''>
  <tr>
    <td class='c006'>In the first period, the excess of deaths above the births, of Slaves, or their annual decrease, was</td>
    <td class='c014'>3½&nbsp;p’c<sup>t</sup></td>

  <tr><td>&nbsp;</td></tr>

    <td class='c014'>1</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p class='c015'>Now, it is manifest, that if the ratio of
decrease had been continually lessening, as
appears on the very face of the account,
and if, during the whole of the last period
of twenty years, the annual loss had been
but 1 per cent., having been 1¾ per cent.
during the former immediately preceding
period of thirteen years, that loss would
be somewhat more than 1 per cent. at
the beginning of the last period, and somewhat
less than 1 per cent. towards the end
of it. But even this loss of 1 per cent.
was itself accounted for, by an extraordinary
series of hurricanes and consequent famines,
from which it was stated that fifteen thousand
Slaves lost their lives; and still more, the
1 per cent. included the loss on all the
Africans who were imported during that
period.  This, which is termed the loss in
the seasoning, has been estimated by high
West Indian authorities, to be, including the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_214'>214</span>loss in the harbour, between 1–4th and 1–3d
of the whole number imported; by some
it has been rated still higher. This mortality
was supposed to be in a considerable
degree occasioned by the Slaves having been
commonly landed in a highly diseased state,
owing in a great measure, as was supposed, to
crowding, and other evils on shipboard: And
the Assembly and Council of Jamaica estimated
that 1½ per cent. of all the Africans imported
died in the short period, probably not
above a fortnight, between the ship’s entrance
into port and the day of sale. Adding together
the whole loss fairly to be ascribed to these
various causes of mortality, of which all depending
on the voyage would obviously cease
with the importations, they would more than
account for the whole 1 per cent. lost during
the last period; and we should be warranted
in concluding, that the whole number
of Slaves in Jamaica were at length actually
on the increase.</p>

<p class='c010'>It will add to your confidence in the conclusion
which so clearly results from the above
calculations, to know that they were carefully
drawn by that great and able minister before
referred to, among whose extraordinary powers,
peculiar clearness and accuracy in calculation
was universally acknowledged to possess
<span class='pageno' id='Page_215'>215</span>an eminent place. Indeed this result ought
not to surprize us, for we were assured by Mr.
Long, many years before, “that upon most of
the old settled estates in the island of Jamaica,
the number of births and deaths every year
is pretty equal, except any malignant disorder
happens.”</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Barbadoes Slaves’ Population.</div>

<p class='c010'>Calculating on the same principles, and from
West Indian accounts, it appeared that in Barbadoes
also, the annual loss of Slaves has been
of late under 1 per cent. Indeed if the loss had
been so small in Jamaica, it probably was not
greater in most of the other islands, into which,
in general, the importations had been less considerable,
and in which, from their several circumstances,
the population was likely to be, to
say the least, full as well kept up as in Jamaica
itself.  <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Second Proposition proved.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> Thus the second proposition was established, that, notwithstanding the general
prevalence of so many and great abuses, the
annual decrease was very inconsiderable.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Third Proposition.</div>

<p class='c010'>The third proposition, that therefore an
increase might in future be expected, must
doubtless rest on the basis of probable inference;
but in a case like this, in which an
appeal is made to a principle of sure and
unerring operation, as established by universal
experience, we may hold our conclusion
<span class='pageno' id='Page_216'>216</span>almost with the certainty of absolute demonstration.
If the many existing abuses would
account for a great annual decrease, yet there
had been no decrease at all, or a very small
one; it clearly follows, that if the prevailing
abuses could be done away, or even considerably
mitigated, we might anticipate in
future a great and rapid annual increase.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Opponents most powerful objections.</div>

<p class='c010'>Our chief opponents of abolition in Parliament
objected neither to the premises on which
our reasonings concerning the West Indian population
were grounded, nor to the conclusions
which we drew from them. They acknowledged,
as has been already stated, to the utmost
extent, the guilt and cruelty of the Slave
Trade. But they urged, that it would be fair
to give the West Indians time for the completing
of their gangs of Slaves, and for the
subsiding of their prejudices; and as they
warmed in argument, advancing in their positions,
they contended, that from the facilities
afforded by the local circumstances of the
islands for smuggling, it would be found impracticable
to abolish the Slave Trade without
the aid of such regulations as could only be
enacted by the West Indian Legislatures themselves.
They trusted, however, the time would
ere long arrive, when, by the general consent
of all parties, this hateful traffic might be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_217'>217</span>abandoned. A respite till the remainder of
the century was alone asked, a period of eight
years, and on the 1st of January 1801, the
reign of justice and humanity was to commence,
and a new and happier day was to
begin to dawn on the wretched Negroes.
Meanwhile, no new settlements were to be
formed, a limited number of Slaves only was
to be annually imported; and other regulations
and measures were to be adopted, with a view
to the general abolition of the Trade in human
beings.</p>

<p class='c010'>Time would fail me, were I to attempt to lay
before you in detail the various discussions
which subsequently took place. It may be
enough to state, that the Abolitionists apprehended,
that if Parliament, acknowledging the
foul injustice and cruelty of the African Slave
Trade, should suffer it to continue for several
years on any such weak and vague grounds as
those of not shocking the prejudices, and acting
contrary to the wishes of the West Indian
proprietors, and on such other pleas as were
urged by our opponents, when it had been
distinctly proved by the greatest political authorities,
who, differing on most other subjects,
entirely concurred on this, that the measure
so far from being ultimately injurious to the
West Indians, would substantially and permanently
<span class='pageno' id='Page_218'>218</span>promote their interests, it would be
in vain that we should flatter ourselves that
any determination to abolish the Slave Trade
at the end of eight years would ever be
adhered to.</p>

<p class='c010'>If obligations so powerful, if duties so clear
and urgent, could be now so easily evaded,
surely at the end of eight years some new
pleas would be set up for the continuance of
the trade, and the Abolitionists themselves
would then be told, that, having formerly recognised
the right of sacrificing the dictates
of justice and humanity to considerations of
expediency, they ought in common consistency
to grant a new respite on the same
or better grounds. Thus, period after period
would be claimed from us, so long as ever the
planters should choose to purchase, or as
Africa should have victims to supply.</p>

<p class='c010'>What has since passed shews that there was
but too much reason for these apprehensions;
for, notwithstanding that a period was fixed
by a majority of the House of Commons;
though a period, far longer than the longest
which was then asked, has since elapsed;
though it was distinctly stated that importations
ought henceforth to be allowed only for
keeping up the cultivation at its actual state;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_219'>219</span>though numbers, prodigiously greater than
any which were then stated as necessary for
filling up gangs, and preparing the islands to
meet abolition, have been since imported;
yet the same difficulties have still been experienced,
the same objections have still been
urged. The wickedness and cruelty of the
Slave Trade have been frankly confessed,
while all our endeavours to put an end to it
have been opposed with undiminished earnestness.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Objection concerning Smuggling, answered.</div>

<p class='c010'>As to the objection, grounded on the impossibility
of preventing Slaves from being
smuggled into the islands, it was argued with
undeniable force, that the power of this
country to prevent the smuggling of Slaves
to any considerable extent, had been proved
by abundant and undoubted experience. Some
trifling supply might be thus introduced, but
in cases wherein it was far more difficult to
prevent a contraband trade, regulations had
been enforced somewhat strictly, which were
opposite to the known and avowed interests
and feelings of all the inhabitants of the West
Indian islands.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Grand objection: Co-operation of Colonial Legislatures necessary:</div>

<p class='c010'>But the consideration which appeared to
weigh most powerfully against an immediate
abolition was the expediency, if not the absolute
<span class='pageno' id='Page_220'>220</span>necessity, of the co-operation of the West
Indian Legislatures. They, it was hoped,
would enact such internal regulations as would
rectify any abuses which might prevail in the
system of negro management. Several of the
Colonial Legislatures, it was said, had lately
passed, or were now passing Acts for improving
the condition and treatment of the Slaves.
Similar laws might be anticipated in others
of the islands; and these reforms having
taken place, the domestic stock of Slaves
would gradually increase; the importation
would diminish, and the Slave Trade would
ere long die of itself.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Considered.</div>

<p class='c010'>It must be to suppose the Abolitionists absolutely
void of all common sense, to imagine
that they were not well aware how greatly
the introduction and establishment of the
necessary reforms in the negro system would
be facilitated by the planters being willing to
adopt them. But, from the very first, there
was but too much reason to fear that no
hearty co-operation would be afforded on
their part.</p>

<p class='c010'>In the first place it should be remembered,
that they appeared to be impressed with a
persuasion, that though the profit was theirs,
the guilt and shame were exclusively our
<span class='pageno' id='Page_221'>221</span>own; and it was not probable that they would
voluntarily consent to dissolve a contract so
much to their advantage. Soon after the abolition
was first proposed, this sentiment was
stated in the most explicit terms by the Assembly
of Jamaica. “The African trade (they say)
is purely a British trade, carried on by British
subjects, residing in Great Britain, on capitals
of their own. The connection and intercourse
between the planters of this island and the
merchants of Great Britain trading to Africa,
extend no further than the mere purchase of
what British Acts of Parliament have declared
to be legal objects of purchase.” But
independently on all other considerations, the
spirit of party had gone forth, and the operation
of that powerful cause would alone prevent
the West Indians from forwarding the
views of those whom they regarded as their
determined opponents; especially since their
concurrence might be supposed to imply a
recognition of the various abuses and evils of
the West Indian system. The Abolitionists
therefore found themselves very early compelled
to abandon all hopes of obtaining the
abolition of the Slave Trade, through the enforcement
of regulations to be prescribed by
the colonial legislatures. It was not going too
far to argue, that the colonial assemblies neither
<span class='pageno' id='Page_222'>222</span>were able, nor, if able, would they be
willing to produce the desired effect.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Colonial Legislatures neither able nor willing to effect the abolition, by regulations as to the detail of management of Slaves.</div>

<p class='c010'>It must be manifest to any one at all acquainted
with the principles of human nature,
and still more clear to any one who
knows the peculiar circumstances of our West
Indian settlements, that any laws which might
be passed by the legislatures of the islands,
would not of themselves be adequate to the
end in view. Granting that the legislatures
might fix the quantity of food and clothing
which all masters were to allow their Slaves,
that they might also prescribe the degree of
labour to be exacted, the punishments to be inflicted,
the instruction to be given, and other
regulations with a view to moral reform;
How could they see to the execution of their
own laws? Put the case of a similar law, applicable
to servants in this country; how
impossible would it be found to enter into the
interior of every family, and with more than
inquisitorial power to ascertain the observance
or the breach of the rules which should have
been laid down for our domestic economy.
How much more difficult in the West Indies,
where the testimony of Negroes not being admissible,
there would be no means of bringing
proof of any violations of the rules prescribed.
But supposing the means of enforcing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_223'>223</span>the regulations to be found, how odious,
how utterly intolerable would such a system
be found in its execution! Would it be borne
even in this country?</p>

<p class='c010'>But let it be remembered, that this kind of
inquisition would be still less endured in the
West Indies than it would be here. For, it
has been often observed, and it is undeniably
true, “that wherever slavery is established,
they who are free are peculiarly proud and
jealous of their freedom.” Mr. Edwards
has more than once declared this to be true
with respect to the inhabitants of our West
Indian Colonies, and this principle would
assuredly cause them to regard with jealousy,
and resent with indignation, any interference
of the officers of government in the management
of their private concerns and family
affairs, among which their treatment of their
own Slaves must fairly be included.</p>

<p class='c010'>But in truth all such general regulations
of the kind here supposed, entering into all
the detail of domestic economy, and prescribing
the precise quantum of food, clothing,
labour, punishment, and medical care, must
be, in their own nature, inherently defective.
The quantity of food which they should
direct, might in some cases be greater, in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_224'>224</span>others less, than would be necessary; accordingly
as the land which the Negroes had
for growing their own provisions was more
or less in quantity, more or less productive.
Again, the medical care, the labour,
the instruction, the discipline, the correction
which might be called for on some estates,
would not be required on others. And then
all these provisions, so vexatious and invidious
in their nature, were to be observed, not
merely gratuitously, but it was to be expected
that people would submit to them, would lend
themselves to the enforcing of them, for the
purpose of accelerating the period of abolition;
an event which they had frankly declared
they conceived would be in the highest
degree injurious to their interests. Surely no
credulity could be sufficient to make any one
believe that laws of such a kind, and for such
a purpose, and with such a premium on
obeying them, could ever be carried into
execution.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Proofs subsequently furnished, that no hope from Colonial Legislatures.</div>

<p class='c010'>But if these and other arguments rendered
it abundantly clear, when the question was
first discussed, that the colonial legislatures
neither could nor would apply any adequate
reform to the existing abides, so as effectually
to cooperate in measures for the abolition
of the Slave Trade, there is now at least no
<span class='pageno' id='Page_225'>225</span>ground for doubt on that head. The question
has been since brought to the test of experiment.
For, an endeavour to obtain the concurrence
of the colonial legislatures has since
been made under the most favourable circumstances
of which the nature of the case could
possibly admit; and yet it is not saying too
much to declare, that the endeavour has
utterly failed.</p>

<p class='c010'>On this as on other occasions, different
motives would operate on different men, in
prompting them to concur in the measure.
For my own part, I sincerely declare, that to
the respectable gentlemen who took the lead
on that occasion, I give the fullest and most
unreserved credit for having been actuated by
an earnest desire of reforming the West Indian
system. But it must be acknowledged that
the transaction in some of its parts, especially
since we have had new light reflected back
on it from recent West Indian communications,
exhibits an appearance of having been
befriended by some of its promoters with a
view rather to defeat, than to promote, the
abolition of the Slave Trade. Be this however
as it may, in the year 1796 a Committee,
consisting of the most respectable
West Indian proprietors, having been appointed
to take into consideration what steps
<span class='pageno' id='Page_226'>226</span>should be taken respecting the Slave Trade,
resolved among other things, “That, for the
joint purposes of opposing the plan of Mr.
Wilberforce, and establishing the character
of the West Indian Planters, it is essential
that they should manifest their willingness
to promote actively the cause of the Negroes,
by such steps as shall be consistent
with safety to the property of individuals,
and the general interest of the colonies;”
and they requested a most justly respected
member of the House of Commons to move
in Parliament, “That an address be presented
to His Majesty, requesting him to recommend
to the colonies the adoption of
such measures, as may promote the increase
of the Negroes, gradually diminish
the necessity of the Slave Trade, and ultimately
lead to its complete termination;
and also as may conduce to their moral and
religious improvement, and secure to them
the certain, immediate, and active protection
of the law.” This address was moved
and carried with the warm support of all
the West Indian party in Parliament; <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Applications to the Colonies<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
and
was transmitted, to the Governors of all the
islands by the Duke of Portland, accompanied
by letters urging the colonial legislatures
to second the wishes of the House of Commons;
private and confidential letters being
<span class='pageno' id='Page_227'>227</span>written to explain to the Councils in the
different islands, the amicable purpose with
which this otherwise perhaps questionable
measure had been proposed, and assuring
them, “that the adoption of some legislative
provisions relative to the Negroes was indispensably
necessary, not only to stop for
the present, but gradually to supersede the
very pretensions at a future period, to a
measure of direct abolition of the Slave
Trade by the mother country.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Thus the concurrence of the West Indian
legislatures was requested by their own tried
friends and counsellors, on that most acceptable
and pleasing ground, of superseding the
abolition of the Slave Trade. It might have
been conceived, that, by the administration of
such a powerful opiate, the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">esprit de corps</span></i>
of the islands would be lulled asleep; and,
though it might even be from motives less
pure than those of their friends at home, that
they would at least adopt the line of conduct
which had been recommended.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Colonial answers.</div>

<p class='c010'>But how different has been the issue!
You are already apprized of the conduct of
the island of Barbadoes, to which Lord Seaforth,
most honourably glad to avail himself
of an opportunity of introducing the measure
<span class='pageno' id='Page_228'>228</span>under such favourable auspices, recommended
the rendering a capital crime, the wilful
murder of a Negro, which is now punishable
only by a fine of about £.11. 10<em>s.</em> sterling.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Assembly of Jamaica assert, “that
the right of obtaining labourers from Africa
is secured to them on the most solemn engagements;
and that they never can give up,
or do any act that may render doubtful, this
essential right.” The General Council and
General Assembly of all the Leeward islands
state, “that the right of procuring labourers
from Africa, has been secured to us by repeated
Acts of Parliament, &amp;c. We, therefore,
never can abandon it, or do any thing
that may render doubtful this essential
right.” The language of these answers is
but too intelligible. But some communications
lately made to Parliament, render it if
possible still more clear than it before was to
all considerate and impartial men, that it is in
vain to expect much effect from the regulations
which any colonial acts may prescribe.</p>

<p class='c010'>It may here perhaps be proper to state,
that since the abolition of the Slave Trade
came into question, acts have been passed for
securing better treatment to the Slaves. It
is no more however than justice to the Island
<span class='pageno' id='Page_229'>229</span>of Jamaica, to take this opportunity of declaring,
that the Legislature of that island had
passed a law rendering the murder of a Slave
a capital crime, and containing various other
salutary regulations, before the motion for
abolishing the Slave Trade had been brought
forward; though at the same time a fact then
became public, which affords a curious proof
how little the treatment of Slaves is really
affected, one way or another, by public laws.
For it appeared from the Assembly’s own
communication, that, for three years immediately
preceding this last reformation, an interval
happening to take place between the
repealing of a former consolidated Slave law
for the protection and security of the Slaves,<a id='r41' /><a href='#f41' class='c011'><sup>[41]</sup></a>
and the passing of a new one, there were for
three years together no laws whatever in
being for the protection and security of the
Slaves; and yet it was not found that the
smallest difference in the treatment of the
Slaves had been occasioned. They were just as
well secured without laws as with them. In
truth, as was before stated, the real protection
of a Slave must lie in his master’s disposition
to protect him.—But to resume the discussion.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_230'>230</span>What has been already urged may perhaps
appear sufficient to prove, that all the colonial
laws for reforming the vices of the West Indian
system, must be practically inefficient. Nor can
any farther argument be necessary, in order to
enforce a conclusion so manifestly resulting
from the circumstances of the case. To some
persons however it may render the point still
more clear, to know, that the inefficacy, to say
no worse, of the late Colonial Slave Acts, is
decisively established even on West Indian
authority itself.</p>

<p class='c010'>For, about two years ago, on the application
of His Majesty’s Secretary of State to the
Governors of the West Indian Islands, for information
as to the manner in which the late
Acts for the better protection of Slaves had
been executed, it clearly appeared, that though
those laws had been passed so few years before
with so much pomp and circumstance,
yet that their provisions had never been carried
into effect. This applies not merely
to the impossible regulations, so to term them,
prescribing the precise quantity of the food and
clothing, and labour and punishment of the
Slaves, but to all those regulations which really
were of perfectly easy execution. There
had been the same entire neglect of the religious
and moral regulations, in which the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_231'>231</span>Owner’s duty was clear and easy, even granting
that his success might be difficult and
doubtful.</p>

<p class='c010'>This utter neglect of the Slave laws might
alone have tended to give effectual confirmation
to the suspicion, that the laws had been
intended for the protection of the Slave Trade,
rather than of the Slaves. This indeed was
plainly stated by a British Officer, who was
resident in one of the islands in 1788, when
one of the earliest and best of these boasted
laws was enacted. It was the general language
of the Colonists at the time, that its
only real operation would be, to supersede
any similar measures which might otherwise
be adopted by the British Parliament.
But much to the honour of the Governor of
the only island from which any satisfactory
information has been returned, he has distinctly
stated,—“The Act of the Legislature,
entitled, “An Act for the Encouragement,
Protection, and better Government of
Slaves,” appears to have been considered,
from the day it was passed, until this hour,
as a political measure to avert the interference
of the mother country in the management
of Slaves. Having said this,
your Lordship will not be surprised to learn,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_232'>232</span>that the 7th clause of that Bill has been
wholly neglected.”</p>

<p class='c010'>It may be proper to mention, that the clause
which has been thus wholly neglected, was
enacted for the express purpose of securing, as
far as possible, the good treatment of the
Slaves, and ascertaining the causes of their
decrease. Some farther information, much to
the same effect, was contained in a letter to
the Secretary of State, from another correspondent,
concerning the encouragement
which the law had required to be given to
Slaves to marry.</p>

<p class='c010'>After this, can any reasonable expectations
be entertained, that the Colonial Legislatures
will cordially concur in any measures for the
abolition of the Slave Trade? Can the Abolitionists
be deemed uncandid, for not greatly
confiding in any statutes which those assemblies
may enact, in co-operation with the British Parliament,
for the abolition of the Slave Trade?</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Laws for the protection of Slaves ineffectual in the old French, Spanish, and Portuguese Settlements.</div>

<p class='c010'>It ought earlier to have been stated, as an additional
proof of the inefficacy of all legal regulations
for the government and protection of
Slaves, that they have fallen into practical disuse
even in countries in which the matters do
not themselves enjoy that political freedom
<span class='pageno' id='Page_233'>233</span>with which all such regulations are peculiarly at
variance; and where, it might have been preconceived,
a government perfectly despotic
possessed abundant means of giving effect to
its own regulations.</p>

<p class='c010'>The better treatment of the Slaves in the
Spanish and Portuguese Settlements, is much
more to be ascribed to the influence of their
religious zeal, and its happy consequences,
than to the institution of a Protector among
the one, or to the provisions of the Directorio
on the other.</p>

<p class='c010'>Again, under the more despotic system of
government which was established in the
French islands before the revolution, the Code
Noir, and various other edicts, which from time
to time had been issued, concerning the treatment
of Slaves, were become a mere dead letter.
It is a curious proof, how much the practice
and the opinions and feelings produced by it
may differ from the law, that the free coloured
people had for an entire century been
legally entitled to that equality of rights and
privileges with the whites, the granting of
which, by the national assembly of the mother
country, produced so violent a ferment among
the white inhabitants of St. Domingo; and
the retractation of which, after its having
<span class='pageno' id='Page_234'>234</span>been granted, followed by fresh grants and
fresh retractations, produced the confusion
which terminated in the loss of that flourishing
colony.</p>

<p class='c010'>But besides that fundamental objection to
statutes, for regulating the treatment of Slaves,
and securing for them, to use the words of the
colonists themselves, the <em>certain, immediate, and
active protection of the law</em>, that they must
prove utterly inefficient; <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Legal protection of Slaves in an abject state of slavery either impracticable or unsafe.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> I must frankly acknowledge my opinion, that all those legal regulations which, in the various particulars of treatment, interfere between the Master and Slave; which interpose between them some external authority to which the Slave, when ill used, is to have a right to apply for protection and redress; unless, as I before observed, they
are not executed, must prove in practice unspeakably
dangerous. This is true at least
where Slaves are in a state of such abject
slavery as that which has so long prevailed
in our West Indian islands, and where the
Slaves so greatly outnumber the free men,
and the difference between Slave and Freeman,
is marked and palpable. In extreme
cases of ill-treatment, or rather in cases of
enormous cruelty, it might be practicable to
apply some remedy, by the means of that
regulation which was established in Athens,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_235'>235</span>and which, with additions most grateful to a
humane mind, prevails, we are assured, in the
Spanish islands, of allowing the Slave when
extremely ill treated, to be transferred to
another owner. But this regulation is not
applicable to those particulars of treatment,
which are constant and systematic, such as
underfeeding, overworking, and other general
vices of management, whether arising out of
degradation, absenteeship, speculation, the
pressure of the times, or any other of the
causes which have been above specified.
And it is these systematic vices which constitute
the real evils in the condition of the
bulk of our Slaves.</p>

<p class='c010'>In these cases of systematic management,
of daily and almost hourly recurrence, the interposition
of a new tribunal of appeal for
checking the master’s authority, and compelling
him, by the dread of penalties, to be more
liberal in his allowances of food and rest, and
more abstemious as to labour and punishment;
in short, to force him to amend the Slave’s
treatment in future in all the undefinable particulars
into which it ramifies, or even to compensate
to the Slave his past ill usage, would in
practice be soon found productive, not only of
extreme discontent, insubordination, and commotions
on private properties, but of the most
<span class='pageno' id='Page_236'>236</span>fatal consequences to the safety of the whole
colony. Sunk as the Slaves at present are,
we are assured they do not feel into what a
depth they have been depressed. We are
told that they are not shocked, as we are
for them, by the circumstances of a Negro
sale, or by the other degrading particulars
of their treatment; the spirit of the man
is extinct, or rather dormant within them.
But remember, the first return of life after
a swoon is commonly a convulsion, dangerous
at once to the party himself, and to all
around him. Impart to the Slaves the consciousness
of personal rights, and the means
of asserting them; give the Slaves a power
of appealing to the laws; and you awaken in
them a sense of the dignity of their nature,
you call into life a new set of most dangerous
emotions; of emotions, let me repeat it, beyond
measure dangerous, while you continue
the humiliating and ignominious distinctions
to which they now unconsciously submit.
When you encourage your Slave to take account
of his rights, and measure them with
his enjoyments: when you thus teach him
to reflect on the treatment he is receiving;
to compare his own condition with that
of Slaves under other masters; to deliberate
about obtaining redress; and, at last,
to resolve to seek it: when you thus accustom
<span class='pageno' id='Page_237'>237</span>him to think, and feel, and decide, and
act; to be conscious of a wrong; to resent an
injury; to go and relate the story of his ill usage,
thus daring to harbour the idea of
bringing his master to punishment and shame:
when you even enable him to achieve this
victory; Do you think that he will long endure
the wrongs he now tolerates? It is a
remark, if I mistake not, of an ancient historian,
who had the power above all others of
placing before his reader the scene he represents,
that in that celebrated instance in which
a whole army, being hemmed in on all sides by
the enemy, was compelled, according to the
barbarous practice of ancient warfare, to submit
to the shameful condition of going under
a sort of gallows, that each man was rendered
most sensible of his own dishonour, by seeing
the shameful appearance of his comrades in
that disgraceful exhibition. And can you
think that, when affection combines with
indignation, a Negro will bear to see the
wife of his bosom, or a mother the children
of her rearing, driven through their daily
work like the vilest of the brute creation;
and that too when each man can consult with
his fellow, when all they see around them
almost are blacks? Above all, but here I anticipate—when
St. Domingo, and the lessons
which it inculcates, occur to the mind.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_238'>238</span>Surely enough has been said to shew, that
there is no alternative, no practical medium,
between keeping the Slaves sunk in their
present state of extreme degradation, an idea
for which no one, I trust, will be found hardy
enough to contend, and introducing the
milder system of what may not improperly
be termed Patriarchal vassalage (to which
the abolition is an indispensable preliminary)
as the state of training and discipline for a
condition in which they may be safely admitted
to a still more advanced enjoyment of
personal and civil rights.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Mr. Burke’s plan respecting the Slave Trade.</div>

<p class='c010'>And in this place, where we are considering
the different modes which have been proposed
for effecting the abolition of the Slave Trade,
it may be proper to notice another plan of
gradual abolition, which has been often mentioned,
though it has never been yet produced.
No one can doubt that attention is justly due
to it, when they are told that it claims the late
Mr. Burke as its author. In duty to that great
man himself, as well as to the cause which I
am defending, this matter should be explained.
Some years before the abolition of the Slave
Trade had been named in Parliament,
Mr. Burke’s attention had been drawn to
that object. His stores of knowledge were
so astonishingly ample and various, that it is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_239'>239</span>difficult to suppose any subject on which his
great mind was not abundantly furnished.
But certainly very little was known, even by
men in general well-informed, concerning the
nature and effects of the Slave Trade on
the coast, but much more in the interior of
Africa. Nor had we then obtained any of
that great mass of information concerning the
West Indian system of management, which was
procured through the authority and influence
of Government, and which could no otherwise
have been obtained. Mr. Burke, however,
drew up the heads of a plan for regulating
the mode of carrying on the Slave Trade
in Africa, and a system for securing the
better treatment of the Slaves in the West
Indies.</p>

<p class='c010'>When, after the whole subject had been
thoroughly investigated, a motion for the immediate
abolition of the Slave Trade was
made in the House of Commons; Mr. Burke
honoured it with his support. He indeed
stated, that he himself had formerly taken up
ideas somewhat different, with a view towards
the same end; but he added, expressing
himself in that strong and figurative style
which must, methinks, have fixed the matter
of his speech firmly in the memory of all
who heard him, that he at once consigned
<span class='pageno' id='Page_240'>240</span>them to the flames, and willingly adopted our
mode of abolition. I can with truth declare,
that in private conversation, he afterwards
expressed to me his concurrence in our plan.
It is a little hard, therefore, that the authority
of that great man should now be pleaded
against us. Still harder, that this should be
the only use made of it, that, instead of any
attempt to give effect to his intentions, his
plan of abolishing the Slave Trade should be
rendered practically subservient to the continuation
of that traffic. In short, that his
name should be used in complete opposition
to his example. As to the nature and effect
of his proposed plan, I had the opportunity
of perusing it only hastily, and I have
endeavoured, hitherto in vain, once more to
procure a sight of it. It is still however I
believe in being, and will I trust appear in
some authentic form.</p>

<p class='c010'>The plan itself was probably no more than
a rough draught, or rather his first thoughts on
a subject, for forming a right judgment on
which, a full and exact knowledge of facts must
be particularly necessary. That on any subject,
even the first thoughts of so great a man
claim the highest deference, I willingly allow.
But may I not be permitted to indulge a persuasion,
that, from farther information than it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_241'>241</span>was possible for any man then to possess,
concerning the nature and effects of the Slave
Trade in the interior of Africa, into which
no traveller of credit had then penetrated for
some centuries, Mr. Burke would have been
convinced of the inefficacy of the regulations
he proposed to establish for the coast. Of his
West Indian regulations, I will only say, that
while, unless completely neglected in practice,
they would probably have excited an opposition
even more efficient than abolition
itself; while they would have been open from
beginning to end to all objections, grounded on
interference with the internal legislation of
the colonies; they would, more than any other
plan ever heard of, have been liable to the
objections which I have lately urged against
imparting personal rights and the privilege of
complaining to a legal protector, so long as
the Slaves remain in their present condition
of extreme degradation.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Greater efficacy of abolition.</div>

<p class='c010'>With this plan for abolishing, as by a
strange perversion of terms it is styled, instead
of confirming and perhaps perpetuating, the
Slave Trade, by the gradual operation of colonial
statutes, a plan which, though tried
under the most favourable of all circumstances,
has absolutely failed; which has been declared
even by West Indian authority itself
<span class='pageno' id='Page_242'>242</span>to have been proposed for the sake merely of
getting rid of the interference of the British
Parliament; which has been clearly proved
to be utterly inefficient as to practical execution,
and which, if it could be executed, would
immediately become inconceivably dangerous—With
this measure, founded on principles
essentially and unalterably incompatible, either
utterly inefficient or mischievously active,
compare the effects of the measure which we
propose, the abolition of the Slave Trade.</p>

<p class='c010'>The bad effects of the continual introduction
of African Slaves are so manifest as
scarcely to need suggesting. The annual infusion
into the West Indian Colonies of a
great number of human beings, from a thousand
different parts of the continent, with all
their varieties of languages, and manners,
and customs, many of them resenting their
wrongs, and burning with revenge; others
deeply feeling their loss of country and freedom,
and the new hardships of their altered
state; must have a natural tendency to keep
the whole mass into which they are brought,
in a state of ferment; to prevent the Slaves
in general from emerging out of their state of
degradation; and to obstruct, both in them and
in those who are set over them, the growth of
those domestic feelings and habits, and the introduction
<span class='pageno' id='Page_243'>243</span>of those more liberal modes of treatment,
which might otherwise be deemed both
safe, and suitable in the case of Slaves whose
characters were known and who were become
habituated to their situation. But the grand
evil arising from the continuance of importations
from Africa, is, that till they are discontinued,
men will never apply their minds
in earnest to effect the establishment of the
breeding system.</p>

<p class='c010'>But all farther importations being at length
stopped, the Slave market now no longer
holding forth any resource, the necessity
for keeping up the stock would at once
become palpable and urgent. All ideas
of supply from without, being utterly cut
off, it would immediately become the grand,
constant, and incessant concern of every
prudent man, both proprietor and manager,
to attend, in the first instance, to the
preservation and increase of his Negroes.
Whatever may have been the case in the instance
of men at once both liberal and opulent,
the mass of owners have, practically at
least, gone upon the system of working out
their Slaves in a few years, and recruiting their
gangs with imported Africans. The abolition
would give the death-blow to this system.
The opposite system, with all its charities,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_244'>244</span>would force itself on the dullest intellects, on
the most contracted or unfeeling heart. Ruin
would stare a man in the face, if he did not
conform to it. The sense of interest so much
talked of, would not as heretofore, be a remote,
feeble, or even a dubious impulse; but
a call so pressing, loud, and clear, that its
voice would be irresistible.</p>

<p class='c010'>But the grand excellence of the operating
principle of this reform is, that it will stand
between the absentee master and his Slaves;
and while it will promote the interest of the
former, it will secure for the latter the actual
enjoyment of the effects of his benevolent
intentions. Managers would henceforth be
forced to make breeding the prime object of
their attention.  And every non-resident
owner would express himself in terms of an
experienced Barbadian proprietor of superior
rank and fortune; “That he should consider
it as the fault of the manager, if he did
not keep up the numbers of his Slaves.”
The absent owner would have the best security
of which the nature of the case admits for
his Slaves being treated with liberality and
kindness. The operative principle thus supplied
would exactly answer the desired purpose.
It would adapt itself to every variety
of situation and circumstances. It would
<span class='pageno' id='Page_245'>245</span>penetrate into the interior of every plantation;
it would ensure a due quantity of food; it
would provide against too rigorous an exaction
of labour, and enforce the adoption of
those reforms which should be found requisite
for increasing the population. Many of the
improvements which must at once be introduced
are perfectly manifest. But, ingenuity
once set at work in this direction, a thousand
discoveries will be made, a thousand reforms
adopted, and, a manager’s credit and character
now depending on the increase of the Negroes,
not as hitherto on that of the immediate and
clear returns from the estate, the former
would henceforth become the great object of
his study in the closet, and of his conduct in
life and action.</p>

<p class='c010'>The professional Planter’s work shews the
improvements which may be suggested by a
single individual of intelligence and experience,
living on the spot, and superintending
the whole system with an observant eye.
What, then, may be expected when the ingenuity
and attention of a whole community are
set at work in the same direction; to effect the
introduction of moral reforms, the settlement
of families, the discouragement of adultery;
the countenancing, by example as well as precept,
among book-keepers or overseers, of morality
<span class='pageno' id='Page_246'>246</span>and decency, the neglect of which, by
persons of that class, has been hitherto productive
of many injurious consequences.</p>

<p class='c010'>Let us hear therefore no more of the Slaves
invincible habits of profligacy and sensuality,
of their not being susceptible of the restraints,
obligations, duties, and comforts of the marriage
state.</p>

<p class='c010'>Wonder not that they are now sunk into
habits of gross debauchery. Not man alone,
but beings in general, throughout the whole
range of animated nature, instinctively seek the
indulgencies and enjoyments suited to their condition
and capacities. Depressed therefore
nearly to a level with the brute creation,
the negro Slaves instinctively adapt themselves
to their level, and are immersed in
merely animal pursuits. Hence it is, that those
very Negroes, who in Africa are represented
as so eminent for truth, so disinterested in
kindness, so faithful in the conjugal and
domestic relations, so hospitable, so fond of
their children, of their parents, of their
country, gradually lose all these amiable dispositions
with the enjoyments which naturally
arise out of them, and become depraved
and debased by all that is selfish and mercenary,
and deceitful, timid and indolent, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_247'>247</span>tyrannical. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>System of management, how to be reformed.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> Would you raise them from this depressed condition, remember the disease is of a moral nature. It admits therefore only of a moral cure. Take away those particulars which degrade and vilify, and thus expel from the system those circumstances which depress the Slaves below the level of domestic life.<a id='r42' /><a href='#f42' class='c011'><sup>[42]</sup></a> Endeavour in such ways, and by such
instruments, as by experience are found best
fitted for the purpose, to impart to them the
inestimable blessings of religious instruction
and moral improvement and reform,  many of
them would soon shew the happy effect of
these instructions, by a conduct and demeanour
manifestly the result of higher principles;
for I must once more raise my voice against
that gross misconception of the character of
the Negroes (an impeachment of the wisdom
and goodness of their Creator no less than of
our own), which represents them as a race
of such natural baseness and brutality as to
be incapable of religious impressions and improvements.
Encourage marriage and the
rearing of children in the only proper way;
by settling the Slaves in family life, with their
cottage and gardens, and with such other
immunities and comforts and distinctions as
will make them be respected by others and
teach them to respect themselves.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_248'>248</span>I am aware that it has been by no means
uncommon for such masters as have made
the domestic increase their object, to give
rewards to mothers for rearing their children.
Surely they have forgot, that Nature, I
had almost said instinct, would take care of
this for them, if they would but pursue the
previous course she so manifestly dictates. It
is not by a reward to be given at the end of a
year or two, that continual attention can be
purchased, with all the ten thousand cares and
assiduities and kindnesses which both by day
and by night the weakness of infancy requires;
they are to be bought by a different price;
they are to be prompted and repaid by maternal
tenderness, by domestic sympathy, and parental
interest. Give but to the Slaves a home;
let the children be safely born, with a tolerable
prospect of happiness; and let the mothers be
allowed immunities and indulgencies, especially
a little time from field work, morning and
evening, to attend to their infants; bring them
thus acquainted with conjugal duties and conjugal
feelings, with the comforts and emotions
of family life, awaken in them the dormant
sympathies of domestic affection, and they
will soon become creatures of a higher order,
for it is in the soil of domestic life that all the
charities of our nature spring up and flourish.
A new set of feelings will begin to unfold
<span class='pageno' id='Page_249'>249</span>themselves. The Slaves in general will learn
to feel the value of a good character, to covet
the acquisition and strive for the maintenance
of it. They will make it their study to gain
a master’s good opinion and confidence. With
hope to animate, and gratitude to warm, how
soon should we witness willing industry and
hearty services. To these would justly be
added, for in this imperfect state the addition
will doubtless be required, the fear of a
master’s displeasure, and the wholesome restraint
of punishment for the indolent, and refractory,
and vicious. The harshness of their
present bondage being transformed into the
mildness of patriarchal servitude, they will
become capable of still greater blessings, and
more ennobling privileges. The Slaves being
now admitted to be not incapable of moral
obligations, they will surely be acknowledged
to be fit for the lower civil functions;
and, above all, there will be no pretence for
maintaining that grand disqualification, which
alone is sufficient to taint their whole condition
with the bitterness of degradation and suffering,
the utter inadmissibility of their evidence.<a id='r43' /><a href='#f43' class='c011'><sup>[43]</sup></a>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_250'>250</span>Thus they would gradually and insensibly be
transformed into a native peasantry.</p>

<p class='c010'>Is it possible to contemplate the change
which has been here slightly traced, without
emotions of the most lively delight? I will
not now indulge myself in the pleasing task
of detailing the several steps of this gratifying
process; but I must state, that in many
of the islands, probably in them all, the
quantity of food must be increased; in
the articles of clothing, lodging, and medical
care, improvements must be adopted; especially
the hours of working must be lessened,
and wherever it is possible, task-work must
be introduced; above all, that degrading practice
of working the Slaves under the whip
must be abandoned. Think not that it will
be enough that females, when clearly pregnant,
shall be spared the more laborious duties
of field work. No; nor even that all the
young women, without exception, shall be
no longer worked under the driver’s lash;
from which, in the judgment of a most respectable
and intelligent planter, innumerable
miscarriages happen in the earlier periods of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_251'>251</span>pregnancy. The system of whip-working itself
must be entirely exploded, and in its
place must be substituted the operation of
those principles which are elsewhere found
universally sufficient for their object, the hope
of reward, and the fear of punishment.</p>

<p class='c010'>In all these particulars I am but recommending
the several reforms enforced with
so much more authority by the professional
Planter, to whom I have so often referred.
All these are preliminary reforms, which must
precede, or rather accompany that most efficient
and beneficial of all improvements, the
combined effect of religious and moral cultivation,
with the comforts of being settled in
families, and the obligations and duties of
conjugal and domestic life. That it may require
reflection, attention, and discretion to
introduce this happy change, I mean not to
deny; it will require also, that a proprietor
should make up his mind to some present
diminution of income, for the sake of larger
ultimate returns. Possibly even some arrangements
of law may here become expedient;
nor will I even affirm, that in one or two particular
islands there may not be instances
(though it is with reluctance that one would
acknowledge such a case) in which proprietors
may have found it their interest hitherto to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_252'>252</span>work down their gangs, and supply vacancies
from the Slave market, to whom therefore
the new system may be injurious, the rather,
because it would of course find their Slaves
nearly ground down by the want of necessaries
and the excess of labour.</p>

<p class='c010'>But with such moderate exceptions as must
necessarily be anticipated in any change so
great, it may be truly affirmed, to be the
excellence and glory of the measure we propose,
that it is likely almost from the very first
to dispense blessings to every individual connected
with it, in every step, from the first to
the last, throughout the whole of it’s progress.</p>

<p class='c010'>Often it happens in human affairs, that
ends the most beneficial must be obtained by
painful and distressing means. Inveterate diseases
can rarely be cured without disgusting
or painful remedies. But how gratifying is
the consideration, that in the present instance,
not only is our ultimate point the seat of security
and happiness, but the way by which
we travel to it is a way of pleasantness and
peace. Its effects cannot be produced at once,
but we are all the while tending to their
complete enjoyment, with an uniform and
uninterrupted course. The Slaves will daily
<span class='pageno' id='Page_253'>253</span>grow happier, the planters richer. The whole
will be like the progress of vegetation; the
effects are not at first perceptible, but the
great principle, operating in ten thousand
instances, will gradually change the whole face
of things, and substitute fertility and beauty
in the place of barrenness and desolation.</p>

<p class='c010'>And all this happy transformation we anticipate,
not from carrying into execution the
speculations of the most intelligent and able
men, but by quitting the ways of injustice and
cruelty, and by entering on those happier
paths, which, by the gracious ordination of
Heaven, are, on the long run, ever found to
lead to safety, prosperity, and happiness. It
may be right to state one consideration, which
may suggest the probability, that even from
the first the island stock of Slaves may not be
found inadequate to the increasing demands
to be made on it.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Waste of labour wherever slavery prevails.</div>

<p class='c010'>It is proved by indisputable reasoning, as
well as by uniform experience, that where slavery
exists, there is always an immense waste
of labour; there is a tendency to accomplish,
by mere force, all which is elsewhere effected
by machinery. How far this has been the
case in the West Indies, is pointed out by various
authors, and particularly with great ability,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_254'>254</span>and perfect knowledge of the subject, by
a late writer.<a id='r44' /><a href='#f44' class='c011'><sup>[44]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>In order, therefore, to form a just estimate
of the means of cultivating the West Indies,
after the abolition shall have taken place,
we must superadd, to a population gradually
increasing, and advancing so much the more
rapidly from the removal of the obstacles to
breeding, and the positive causes of increase
which have been already stated, that great
and incalculable increase in the efficiency of
the force actually employed, which will be
effected by its becoming the immediate and
pressing interest of the proprietors to economise
in the labour of their Slaves, and to
avail themselves of all the means by which
labour may be abridged, and the same produce
may be raised by fewer hands.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Immediate abolition preferable to gradual, both in the West Indies and in Africa.</div>

<p class='c010'>Allow me also to remark that, now especially,
when the planters have had so much
time, since the first proposal of abolition, for
filling up their gangs, the change is likely to
operate more favourably on both sides of the
Atlantic, in consequence of it’s being immediate
and complete, not gradual in it’s operation.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_255'>255</span>In the West Indies, where there is to
be a great change of practical views and objects,
a change too which will be very unwillingly
adopted, men are far more likely
to make up their minds to the new system,
and to set about acting upon it with vigour,
if it be clearly and decisively necessary,
than if there be still some supply, though in
a diminished proportion, to be obtained from
the Slave market. Supposing them in the
first year to fail in their endeavours to obtain
a share of the Slaves allowed to be imported,
they may hope to be more fortunate in the
second. Meanwhile the hope of a resource
in the Slave market will prevent their exerting
themselves in earnest in establishing the
system by which they might secure an internal
increase; and thus they might be drawn on
from year to year to their own ruin, to the
public injury, and to the misery of their unhappy
Negroes.</p>

<p class='c010'>Again, in Africa, were we at once to give
up the Slave Trade, the native chiefs and
factors, who have hitherto entirely depended
on it for their supply of spirits, fire-arms,
ammunition, and other European articles,
having no resource in their old occupation,
would set themselves in earnest to some other
mode of employing their domestic Slaves, in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_256'>256</span>order thereby to procure the desired stock
of European articles. But were the trade to
be abolished by degrees, they, as in the former
case, would hope to obtain a share, though it
should be a smaller share; and this expectation
would be sufficient to prevent their engaging
spiritedly in any undertaking of agriculture
or commerce.</p>

<p class='c010'>It may seem to be anticipating an argument
which ought to receive a separate consideration;
but let me also remark, that our retiring gradually
from the trade, would greatly favour
the entrance of other nations into the post
we had before occupied. It would be utterly
impossible for them to find capital or other
means sufficient for undertaking the whole
of so extensive a commerce; but were we
to give it up by degrees, they might possibly
be able, by great efforts, to obtain the means
of carrying on, part after part, what we should
have abandoned.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Abolitionists falsely deemed inconsistent for not emancipating the West Indian Slaves.</div>

<p class='c010'>And here, perhaps, it may be right to answer
a strange objection, which our opponents, at
a loss, surely, for sound arguments, have
urged against us. I may be able also at once
to vindicate the Abolitionists from two opposite
charges, which have been brought
against them. One class of their opponents,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_257'>257</span>in spite of repeated and most positive assurances
to the contrary, have imputed to them
the design of immediately emancipating the
Slaves. Can it be necessary to declare, that
the Abolitionists are full as much as any other
men convinced, that insanity alone could
dictate such a project. On the other hand, by
another class of opponents, they have been
charged with being unfaithful to their own
principles, in not immediately emancipating
the Slaves already in the islands, as well as
immediately putting a stop to our ravages in
Africa. Sometimes it has been argued, that
we ourselves prove by our conduct in this instance,
that the laws of justice must occasionally
concede somewhat to considerations of
expediency. That therefore they do but extend
a little further than we, the limits of
that concession, when they propose that the
Slave Trade itself, with all its horrors, should
be suffered to continue.</p>

<p class='c010'>It scarcely would be requisite to expose
the sophistry of this argument, if it had not
sometimes proceeded from men of understanding,
whose use of it however can only be
accounted for by the supposition, that they are
utterly unacquainted with the circumstances
of the case.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_258'>258</span>Supposing they were themselves to discover
an unfortunate human being, who, by
long imprisonment and severe treatment, had
been driven into a state of utter madness;
would either justice or humanity prompt them
to grant at once to this unfortunate man the
unconstrained enjoyment of his natural liberty?
On the contrary, would not these
principles rather inculcate the duty of endeavouring
by proper medical regimen, by salutary
restraint, and if necessary even by the
harsher expedient of wholesome discipline, to
restore him to his senses, and qualify him
for that freedom which he might afterwards
enjoy?</p>

<p class='c010'>The West Indian Slaves are in a state which
calls for a course of treatment founded on
similar principles. It would be the grossest
violation and the merest mockery of justice
and humanity, to emancipate them at once,
in their present unhappy condition. God forbid
(with most serious reverence I use the
expression) that we should not desire to impart
to the Negro Slaves the blessings of freedom.
No man, I believe, estimates liberty
more highly, or loves it better, than myself.
True liberty, of course, I mean, the child of
reason and law, the parent of order and happiness;
such liberty, as that, of which they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_259'>259</span>must be dull indeed who do not understand
the nature and feel the value, who have lived
in the enjoyment of the blessings which it
dispenses under the form of a British Constitution;
while they have beheld also its perfect
contrast, both in nature and effects, in the
wild licentiousness of a neighbouring kingdom.</p>

<p class='c010'>It is indeed a “plant of celestial growth,”
but the soil and climate must be prepared for
its reception, or it will not bring forth its
proper fruits. These are fruits, alas! which
our poor degraded Negro Slaves are as yet
incapable of enjoying. To grant it to them
immediately, would be to insure not only their
masters ruin, but their own. A certain previous
course of discipline is necessary. They
must be trained and educated for this most
perfect state of manly maturity; and, by a
singular felicity of coincidence, the stoppage
of all further importations from Africa, with
all the consequences which it introduces in
its train, is the very shortest and safest path
by which the Slaves can travel to the enjoyment
of true liberty.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Other objections to Abolition.</div>

<p class='c010'>Besides the great argument urged by the
opponents of the abolition, that of not being
able to maintain their stock of Slaves at its
<span class='pageno' id='Page_260'>260</span>present number and force, without importation
from Africa, a position which, I trust, has
been now most satisfactorily refuted by decisive
appeals both to speculation and experience;
other allegations also were made
concerning the injurious consequences of the
abolition, and of these it may now be proper
to take a brief review.</p>

<p class='c010'>It should however be borne in mind, that
they all depend on the determination of the
great question concerning the keeping up of the
population, except so far only as the African
Slave Trade is in question; and, with the exception
before made, of persons connected
with places whence this bloody traffic is carried
on (now, to the honour of the kingdom,
but two, London and Liverpool), none have
been found such steady advocates for the
Slave Trade, as to contend for its continuance
merely for it’s own sake.</p>

<p class='c010'>The opponents of abolition, and especially
some of our great colonial antagonists, have
confidently stated, that our measure would effect
the speedy destruction of our West Indian
colonies; and that in consequence of the loss
of national capital which we should sustain,
and from our no longer importing the productions
of our Western colonies, the abolition
<span class='pageno' id='Page_261'>261</span>would bring down utter ruin on the commercial,
manufacturing, maritime, and financial
interests of the empire.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Abolition injurious to our Commerce, Manufactures, &amp;c., &amp;c.</div>

<p class='c010'>I am far from denying the political, commercial,
and financial advantages we have derived
from the West Indies, or the benefit resulting
to us, as a maritime nation, from the
distant situation of those possessions. Still it
is impossible to admit the principles of calculation,
any more than the reasoning, of our
opponents, when they state the whole loss
which the public will sustain by the abolition
of the Slave Trade.</p>

<p class='c010'>They commonly begin by putting down as
loss, very nearly the whole value of our exports
to Africa, together with that of all the
ships and sailors employed in that branch of
commerce. They enlarge much also on the
evils resulting from the suddenness of the
shock, by so large a share of the national capital,
as well as of our ships and seamen,
being all at once thrown out of employment;
they then pass over to the West Indies, and
sum up the value of the West Indian estates of
all kinds belonging to British subjects, with
their buildings, Negroes, and other stock. To
these they add the value of all the exports and
imports, to and from the West Indies; with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_262'>262</span>all the revenue derived from them, and the
shipping and sailors which they employ;
and then they tell us, that, adding the value
of all these various articles together, we shall
find the amount of our loss.</p>

<p class='c010'>With respect to the African branch of the
foregoing statement, all who believe with me,
that the Africans are not incapable of civilization,
and that when the fatal barrier shall
be broken down, which along the whole
western frontier has shut out all the improvements
to be derived from a bloodless intercourse
with more polished nations, they may
gradually advance to a state of social order,
comfort, and abundance; all who entertain
hopes like these, will anticipate the immense
amount of the commercial transactions which
Britons in future times may carry on with
that vast continent; and surely our descendants
will, at the same time, wonder that their
forefathers, on principles even of mere commercial
gain, could be blind to the advantages
to be derived from diffusing our manufactures
through a region which constitutes almost a
third part of the habitable globe.</p>

<p class='c010'>Even our opponents themselves will acknowledge,
that the suddenness of the shock
is alone to be regarded. The objection on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_263'>263</span>this ground was quite satisfactorily, though
briefly refuted, in the concise statement formerly
referred to. It appears, that, even
before the abolition of that large part of the
Slave Trade which consisted in supplying
foreigners, and the French and Dutch conquered
settlements with Slaves; the capital
employed in the Slave Trade was but about
one thirty-fifth part of the whole of our
capital employed in foreign trade; and it
was very truly affirmed, that “very few
changes ever take place in the political
arrangements of the state, or in its measures
of commercial œconomy, which are
not attended with a much greater shifting
of capital, than the abolition of the Slave
Trade, however sudden, could have effected
in the periods of its greatest prosperity.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The assertion, that we should be injured by
suddenly throwing out of occupation the
ships and seamen employed in the African
Trade, was shewn to stand on still weaker
grounds. When at its very highest amount,
an amount far higher than it will ever again
reach, unless we even replace the branches
which we have actually lopped off, it employed
not one-sixtieth part of our whole
tonnage; not one twenty-third part of our
seamen. But so far as our seamen are in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_264'>264</span>consideration, it will scarcely be disputed by
any Naval Officer, that we should gain by the
extinction of the Slave Trade.</p>

<p class='c010'>With respect to the West Indian part of the
price, as calculated by our opponents, which
Great Britain must pay for obeying the dictates
of justice and humanity, by abolishing
the Slave Trade; we must remark, that they
forget that the revenue at least, derived from
the taxes raised on West Indian productions,
is paid by the subjects of this country. Other
objections of detail might be made to their
calculations. But, passing by these, let me
observe, that, above all, they utterly forget,
that in this reasoning they take for granted
the whole question in dispute; for the Abolitionists
maintain, that, while the abolition
would produce a gradual increase of our exports
to the West Indies, from the improving
condition of the bulk of their population;
our revenue, our imports, and our marine, dependent
on them, would be fixed on a basis far
more safe and durable than that on which they
now rest. But in considering the question on
the grounds of policy, it is ever to be kept in
mind, that the alternative is not, whether or
not we shall take a step which is affirmed, on
one side, to be big with mischief, while the
opponents only maintain, on the other, that it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_265'>265</span>will be productive of no injury. It is, whether
we shall take a step, which may perhaps
produce some slight inconveniencies, or whether
we shall subject ourselves, by refusing to
take it, to great and inevitable calamities.
The West Indian proprietors who are friends
of the Slave Trade cannot be more positive
that its termination will be injurious to their
interests, than the Abolitionists are, that its
continuance is every moment threatening
them with ruin.</p>

<p class='c010'>But when the Colonists tell us that the
system which we recommend to them, would
be injurious to their own and the national
welfare, in opposition to the repeatedly
avowed opinions of those great statesmen, in
the sense of national interest entertained by
the one or by the other of whom they have
all, in every other instance, concurred; are
we not also entitled to say, that their system
has at least had a full and fair trial, and that
the issue of this experiment has been to bring
our old colonies in general into such an extremity
of distress and embarrassment, as even
the realizing of the utmost apprehensions
which our opponents have entertained from
the abolition could scarcely exceed?</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Present West Indian System ruinous.</div>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_266'>266</span>Here again an immense field opens to our
view. But I must take a most hasty survey of it;
otherwise it would be no difficult task to
prove, that the Slave Trade, and the system
of management with which it is intimately
associated, has, in various ways, tended to
this unprosperous issue. The eyes of the
public have been dazzled by the sight of some
splendid fortunes, which, it is understood,
have been rapidly acquired; while the liberal,
not to say profuse, tempers and habits of the
West Indian gentlemen, tempers and habits
naturally generated by a system of slavery, as
well as by a tropical climate, and which are
powerfully promoted by the prodigious variations
in the annual returns of their estates,
tend to keep up the delusion.</p>

<p class='c010'>But West Indian speculations, which have
often been called a lottery, are, like the lottery,
on the whole a very losing game. This
will be the more readily assented to, when it
is stated, that in Jamaica, by far the largest of
our colonies, taking the whole island together,
the planters capital, as was stated in 1789 to
the Privy Council, by a Committee of the
Council of the island, does not yield more
than about 4 per cent.; and this, it is to be
observed, is not obtained by all adventurers in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_267'>267</span>about an equal proportion; but as some derive
great gains, others are proportionably
losers. In some few of the smaller islands,
the profit on the capital was stated to be somewhat,
but only a little more.</p>

<p class='c010'>The facility of purchasing labourers afforded
by the Slave Trade has tempted multitudes
to their ruin. Sometimes a great number of
Slaves, for which no adequate preparations
were made, have been put to the most unhealthy
and laborious of all employments, the
clearing of new land, and forming of new settlements.
Accordingly, it has followed for
the most part but too naturally, that the Slaves
have perished, and the estate has been either
thrown up, or sold for the benefit of the
creditors.</p>

<p class='c010'>These are no new speculations. Mr. Long,
above thirty years ago, dilated on the evils of
this system in the strongest terms. He even
went so far as to recommend, with a view to
the prevention of them, a temporary stoppage
of the importation of Slaves from Africa; and
he confirmed his reasoning by appealing to
the experience of one of our North American
colonies, which, when involved in the deepest
distress by the operation of similar circumstances,
had been retrieved from a state of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_268'>268</span>almost utter ruin by the adoption of a similar
expedient.</p>

<p class='c010'>We have had an opportunity of receiving
but too decisive a proof of the bad effects of
suffering the opposite system to go on without
restraint. Even twenty-six years ago they
had exhibited a display of ruin, which was
scarcely equalled by the effects of any regular
and permanent cause of evil, in any other age
or country. It would scarcely have appeared
credible, if it were not established by the records
of a public court, that in twenty years,
from 1760 to 1780, the executions on estates
in the Sheriff’s court amounted in number
to above 80,000, and were to the amount
in value of £.32,500,000 currency, or about
£.22,500,000 sterling. Again; of all the
sugar estates in the island at the beginning of
the same period of twenty years, nearly one
half were, at the end of it, either thrown up
as not worth cultivating, or were in the hands
of creditors, or mortgagees, or had been sold
for their benefit.<a id='r45' /><a href='#f45' class='c011'><sup>[45]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>This was many years before the abolition
of the Slave Trade had ever been proposed;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_269'>269</span>and one would have conceived, that the consequences
of the system which had been so
long pursued, might alone have produced a disrelish
for it, and have predisposed the Colonists
to adopt another which was recommended by
the highest authorities. Prejudice, however,
and party spirit, were too powerful for reason
and sound policy, as well as for humanity and
justice. And what has been the result? The
affairs of the colonies have gone on from bad
to worse, until the distress being extremely
aggravated by another cause, to be presently
noticed, the great island of Jamaica is represented,
by its own legislature, in a state, to use
the compendious terms of a very able and experienced
West Indian proprietor, of general
distress and foreclosure of property.</p>

<p class='c010'>During all this time a debt to the mother
country, before prodigious, has been gradually
accumulating; or rather, perhaps, to say the
truth, the merchants of London have for the
most part become the real proprietors of colonial
estates; while the resident, and even sometimes
the absentee planters, have been little
more in reality than their stewards and agents.</p>

<p class='c010'>You will naturally be astonished at the
facts which have been here stated; you will
naturally ask, what temptations can have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_270'>270</span>been sufficiently strong to prompt men to go
on in such a continued course, with speculations
which have proved in the main so unprofitable?
It is really difficult to account satisfactorily
for the phœnomenon. Much is
certainly to be ascribed to the operation of
that principle in our nature, the gambling
principle as it may be termed, the existence
and effects of which have been so well explained
by Dr. Adam Smith; the disposition
to overrate our probable success, and to assign
too little weight to contingencies which may
disappoint our expectations. However, in
the present instance, besides this general
cause, we may discover several specific causes
of sure and highly powerful operation.</p>

<p class='c010'>The West Indies are a very wide field, and
some few instances of great and rapid success
attract more notice than the far more numerous
cases which terminate in ruin. The
British merchant’s profit from consignments
ensures a somewhat ready disposition to assist
adventurers in planting. When also, as often
happens, there is a glut of Slaves in the West
Indian market, as they are an expensive
article while they remain unsold, the planter
can buy them on a proportionably longer
credit. Two and even three years are not
seldom allowed; the Planter therefore is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_271'>271</span>tempted to purchase Slaves even if he does
not greatly want them, in the hope, that before
the time of payment arrives, they will
have more than worked out their cost, by the
sugars which their labour will have brought
to market. In like manner the British merchant
trusts, that before the bills drawn on
him shall become due, the sugars in his hands
will meet them. Thus encouraged, the planter
buys. Meanwhile the Slaves must be set to
work; and the inadequate funds of their master,
the same cause which curtails their food and
abridges their other comforts, causes them
to be worked the harder. They sicken and
drop off, and perish in what is called the <em>seasoning</em>,
a mode of death sufficiently important
and notorious to have obtained this epithet;
a somewhat singular one, considering that the
climate of the West Indies and Africa are so
much the same. Yet this is a system, which,
ruinous as it is, has a natural tendency to increase;
which may grow even to an indefinite
extent. The evils of it, however, though
too long unacknowledged, are now at least
felt by all who are not blinded by interest or
passion. An immense mass of the national
capital has thus been invested, I had almost
said has been sunk, in our Trans-Atlantic
Empire. In one respect it may be said, that,
in accordance with the principles so clearly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_272'>272</span>developed by the great political Economist
who has been already named, our commercial
accumulations have found their way to the
land, and have become an agricultural capital.
But it is to land many thousand miles removed
from the mother country.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Excessive accumulation of capital in the West Indies.</div>

<p class='c010'>I admit all the advantages, to their utmost
extent, which we derive, considered as a maritime
nation, from these distant possessions.
But there are peculiar circumstances in their
situation, which must make every considerate
politician acknowledge how much more it
would have been for the benefit of this
country if a part of that capital had been employed
at home. What is expended in the
improvement of our own soil is so much permanently
added to the wealth, resources, and
population of Great Britain. It is well digested,
and well assimilated nutriment; and
it adds proportionably to our muscular strength.
It is inseparably a part of ourselves; it must
share our fortunes; and in all times and circumstances
contribute to our benefit. Even
the wealth which is acquired by British subjects
in the East Indies is brought home to be
spent in our own country. It improves our
land, or it increases the funds to be employed
in commercial or manufacturing enterprizes.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_273'>273</span>How differently circumstanced is that part
of our national capital, which is invested in
the West Indies. It is in a situation where
it is peculiarly open to seizure; and where,
in consequence, it often invites the attack of
an enemy, while at the same time it is defended
at an immense expence of the lives
of our fellow subjects. From a fatal principle
of internal weakness, it may at once
be dissipated by the explosion of an insurrection,
or it may be separated from us by
other events which no one can call impossible.
Not only would our gain, from a large part at
least of this capital, have been greater in
amount, if it had been invested within our
own island; but still more, the gain, whatever
it might have been, would have been held by
a less precarious tenure. Of West Indian, even
more truly than of any other riches, it may be
affirmed, that they are apt to make themselves
wings and fly away.</p>

<p class='c010'>But notwithstanding the decisive proofs
which have been adduced, of the ruinous
consequences of the existing system; notwithstanding
the tried efficiency, and salutary
operation, of those great principles, to which,
in the event of the abolition, we look for the
advancing safety, happiness, and greatness
of our Western Colonies; notwithstanding,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_274'>274</span>still more, the acknowledged authority of that
great man, whose opinion of the tendency of
the abolition to promote the solid and permanent
prosperity, as well as security, of the
West Indies, was so repeatedly declared—I
am yet aware that the statement of the
contrary opinion by the Colonists themselves,
and by their agents and correspondents in
this country, greatly biasses the judgment of
many considerate and respectable men.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Probable causes of the opposition to abolition.</div>

<p class='c010'>Allow me therefore to make a few observations
on this head, and to consider a little
whether there may not be other causes besides
reason and argument, from which the continued
opposition of what is termed the West
Indian body may probably be owing in no
inconsiderable degree.</p>

<p class='c010'>It is not surprising that a great effect has
been produced by the declaration of so numerous
and respectable a class of the community
as that of the West Indian body, that
the abolition would be ruinous to their interests;
especially, considering that there has
been full scope for the operation of party
spirit, we should not be surprized to find this
opinion held somewhat strongly and generally
by the colonial world, and their numerous
connections. Yet surely we have been too
<span class='pageno' id='Page_275'>275</span>much accustomed to hear men predicting the
most fatal consequences from incidents and
measures, which have been depending, when
the event has afterwards proved that their
fears, if not utterly groundless, have been at
least excessively magnified, to conclude that
the mere circumstance of such apprehensions
being entertained, is a sufficient proof of
their having a sound foundation. We have
already stated a striking instance of this kind,
in the progress of this very contest—that of
the violent opposition which was made by
all the parties concerned, to the passing of
the Slave-carrying Bill; a measure which a
very few years after was acknowledged, as
it is still universally confessed, to have been
beneficial to them all. One of the most efficient
of the opponents of abolition, in 1792,
frankly acknowledged this common delusion;
and even declared, that he anticipated the
period when the question of abolition itself
would afford another instance of its having
occurred. He stated a particular fact in confirmation
of his opinion; which, as the story
is not long, it may be worth while to
relate.</p>

<p class='c010'>“There was a species of slavery prevailing
only a few years ago in some boroughs in
Scotland. Every child that carried a coal
<span class='pageno' id='Page_276'>276</span>from the pit, was the bound slave of that
borough. Their emancipation was thought
by Parliament to be material; and was
very much agitated in the House. It was
urged by those who opposed the emancipation,
that, let every man’s genius be what
it might, yet that those pits in which the
work, from its nature, was carried on
under ground, were quite an excepted case;
and that without the admission of slavery in
this particular instance, the collieries could
not be worked; that the price of coals
would be raised to a most immoderate
height; and all the neighbouring manufactories,
which depended on them, would
essentially suffer in their interests. After
several years struggle, the Bill, however,
was carried through both houses of Parliament.
Within a year after, the whole idea
of the collieries being in the least hurt
by the abolition of this sort of slavery,
vanished into smoke, and there was an end
of the business.”</p>

<p class='c010'>I hope therefore, that, notwithstanding the
declared sense of the bulk of the West Indian
body, I may, without being thought presumptuous,
still declare, that renewed consideration
has only confirmed my judgment, that the
abolition of the Slave Trade would be ultimately
<span class='pageno' id='Page_277'>277</span>and permanently beneficial to the
West Indians themselves.</p>

<p class='c010'>It is not lightly that I have taken up the
persuasion, which has been intimated more
than once, that the determined hostility with
which the abolition of the Slave Trade has
been opposed by the bulk of the West Indian
body, is, in a multitude of instances, the effect
of party spirit rather than of rational conviction
after full and fair investigation. It is in
the case of the West Indian party as in that
of parties in general, a few men of superior
zeal and activity give the tone to the rest.
The residents in the islands, the greater part
of whom are either engaged in planting speculations,
or are looking forward to such speculations,
are the real instigators of the opposition.
The West Indian merchants lend
them their zealous and powerful aid; and the
proprietors in this country head the party,
partly from an implicit confidence in the
judgment of others, partly from a liberal feeling,
which renders them unwilling to desert
the cause of their fellow planters abroad; and
if they take any share at all in the contest,
their rank and fortune render it natural for
them to take the lead.</p>

<p class='c010'>By far the greater part however are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_278'>278</span>actuated merely by deference for the opinion
of others; and by that <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">esprit de corps</span></i> which
first renders men unwilling to differ from
their friends, and which, by degrees, produces
warmth, and at length vehemence, by mutual
intercourse, sympathy, and collision.</p>

<p class='c010'>In truth, what force of mind does it not
require in a considerate man of any feeling,
aware of all the low surmises, the invidious
comments, the unkind constructions, the altered
countenances, not to speak of the real
loss of influence and connections to which
he may expose himself, to resolve, on refusing
to join the general party, and to adhere to his
resolution; in such circumstances as those of
the West Indian body; or, even still more, to
quit the party he has joined, when a sense of
duty commands the sacrifice. It is indeed but
too true, that almost in any instance, and never
perhaps in any more than in that of the West
Indian connection, to break through the trammels
of our party, demands the most strenuous,
and, judging from experience, we should
say, one of the most difficult of all efforts.</p>

<p class='c010'>For men to emancipate themselves from
this bondage, it requires not so much an uncommon
degree of judgment and foresight,
not even so much of impartiality and candour,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_279'>279</span>as it calls for such a share of firmness
and independence of mind as rarely indeed
falls to the lot of men in any times, and less
than almost in any other, in our own, in
which fashion and party rule with such a rigorous
despotism, as if it were to revenge on
us our not submitting to any other yoke. Yet
are there not a few West Indian Proprietors,
both in and out of Parliament, who, though
owners of large colonial possessions, have refused
to join the West Indian body; who are
exempt from West Indian prejudices, and
who, to their honour, are resolved that the
source from which their annual income is
derived, shall not be polluted by injustice and
cruelty.</p>

<p class='c010'>There are also various individuals connected
with the colonies, whose complete personal
acquaintance with the whole system of
West Indian management has given them an
opportunity of discovering it’s vices, and has
prevented their becoming the dupes of party
violence or sophistry. And though, in quitting
a formed party when we have once
joined it, we obviously have greater difficulties
to encounter, and obstacles to overcome, than
even in originally refusing to combine with our
brethren in constituting it, yet one splendid
conquest of this kind has been made well it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_280'>280</span>deserves such an epithet, for he, who knows
any thing of human nature, knows full
well, that these are the most difficult of all
masteries.</p>

<p class='c010'>Yet this difficult conquest has been achieved
by one of those gentlemen who originally
took the lead, in committing to the colonial
legislatures the service of superseding the necessity
of abolishing the Slave Trade by internal
regulations. He has since abundantly
proved that he did not support the measure,
in order merely to defeat the efforts of the
Abolitionists, and with a real view of prolonging
the continuance of the Slave Trade;
but that he conceived, that the question then
at issue was, whether that traffic should be
abolished by the Colonial Assemblies or the
British Legislature: and now, that the former
have refused to accept the commission which
the House of Commons offered to instruct to
them, he has embraced the other part of the
alternative, and cordially co-operated in the
attempt to abolish by the Imperial Parliament.
Instances of such conduct as this are rare;
for being rare, they are the more honourable.
The mind loves to dwell on them. Perhaps,
from never having been a party man
myself I may feel their excellencies with
peculiar force.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_281'>281</span>I might offend the delicacy of this gentleman,
by mentioning his name; but surely
without his leave I may venture to describe
him. I fear there are but two or three others
with whom, in all the following particulars,
he can be well confounded. I may state
him, then, to be the Jamaica Proprietor, in
whom I believe humanity and kindness to his
Slaves are hereditary virtues; and who, having
more waste but cultivable land, than almost
any other Jamaica landholder, had more to
gain by the continuance of the Slave Trade,
while he has been among the first to abandon,
or rather to abolish it; who has ever had his
eyes more open than most other proprietors to
the abuses of the West Indian system, and his
endeavours more warmly and actively exerted
to correct them; being more exempt than
most others of his brethren from West Indian
prejudices, but often, I fear, counteracted by the
prejudices of others; who has been desirous
especially of promoting those moral reforms
which would above all other improvements
tend to the comfort of the Slaves, and the
security and prosperity of the islands.</p>

<p class='c010'>This is not general and indiscriminate praise;
each commendation has it’s object. May he
go forward in the path on which he has so
honourably entered, and may he be followed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_282'>282</span>by descendants, inheriting his principles as
well as his property, who may perfect the
work which he has commenced.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Power of party spirit in the West Indians.</div>

<p class='c010'>That the principle of party spirit is adequate
to the production of most powerful
effects; that it may be even sufficient to prompt
men to act in manifest opposition to a clear,
direct and valuable interest, has been decisively
established in the case of our West Indian Proprietors
themselves in a very recent instance.
For, what but this party spirit could cause
them to support the continuance of that
branch of the Slave Trade which consisted in
supplying foreigners with Slaves, and still
more, which could prevent their even strenuously
and eagerly anticipating the efforts
of the Abolitionists for stopping the supply for
the cultivation of the immeasurable expanse
of the South American continent. In the
colonies which we there conquered, near
twenty millions of the capital of this country
were actually invested during the short period
after their conquest, for which we remained in
possession of them during the last war; and,
on their being restored by the peace, all this
vast sum contributed to the improving and
enriching of the colonies of a power which
unhappily even then could be considered only
as the vassal of our already too powerful
<span class='pageno' id='Page_283'>283</span>rival. The proprietor in our old islands will
not deny that those continental settlements
not only have injured him by greatly increasing
the quantity of colonial produce in the market,
but that, enjoying very decided advantages
over our older islands, from a more fertile soil,
from being exempted from hurricanes, from
the opportunity of feeding the Slaves more
plentifully, and at a cheaper rate, they have
been to him the cause of very great loss and
embarrassment. Had this evil been suffered
to advance, the ruin which must have followed
from it, though gradual, would have
been sure and complete. From that misfortune
the Abolitionists have relieved him,
by obtaining the Order of Council, since
confirmed and sanctioned by an Act of
Parliament, for stopping the importation
of Slaves, not only into foreign colonies,
but even into those possessions, chiefly in
Guiana, which in the present war have been
again conquered from the enemy. And surely
we may assume to ourselves some credit for
having willingly rendered to them, our opponents,
the greatest benefit which they could
receive. But while we are engaged on this
topic, let me call on the West Indians in our
own ancient possessions, for whom again I
must declare I feel most good will, as those
<span class='pageno' id='Page_284'>284</span>who have long been our fellow subjects, in
company with whom we have weathered
many a storm and rejoiced after many a victory;
let me call on them to bear in mind a
very probable source of extreme injury to
their particular interests, which will be
opened on the restoration of peace, if the
Slave Trade be not abolished.</p>

<p class='c010'>Supposing us to retain the conquered settlements,
the importation of Slaves cannot be
withheld from the proprietors in those colonies,
while we allow it to their fellow subjects;
yet, if granted to the former, by far the
larger part of our whole export from Africa
will be allotted to their use. Their settlements
will be every year increasing; new
cargoes of colonial produce will be poured by
them into the market, and the planters in our
old islands, for whom and for whose interests
we ought to feel most concern, will be plunged
deeper and deeper into a gulf, in which, by
their own confession, they have already sunk
almost irretrievably. But supposing us even
to give up the conquered West Indian settlements
on the restoration of peace, still Trinidad
will remain to us; and that large and
fertile island would of itself be sufficient to
furnish such an immense quantity of fresh
<span class='pageno' id='Page_285'>285</span>colonial produce as almost to consummate
the ruin at least of our more ancient and less
fertile colonies.</p>

<p class='c010'>To resume the discussion in which I was
lately engaged. Let me again declare, that
so much do I ascribe to the effects of that
party spirit of which I have treated so largely,
that I am convinced, if the colonial proprietors
were not warped by prejudice, and
heated by <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">esprit de corps</span></i>, such of them
as are really well acquainted with the subject
in it’s various parts and bearings, would be
in favour of abolition; they would agree
with me, that, excepting only some particular
interests, the present West Indian system,
and, above all, the Slave Trade, as it’s basis
and ground-work, are contrary to sound policy,
no less than to justice and humanity. In
truth, this question has been already decided;
for, we have been assured by the same respectable
gentleman who was before alluded
to, that, above thirty years ago, the following
question was discussed in Kingston, the capital
of Jamaica, in a society formed of the first
characters of the place, “Whether the Trade
to Africa for Slaves was consistent with
sound policy, the laws of nature and morality.”—The
discussion occupied several
meetings, and at last was determined, by a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_286'>286</span>majority, that the Trade to Africa for Slaves
was neither consistent with sound policy, the
laws of nature, or morality<a id='r46' /><a href='#f46' class='c011'><sup>[46]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c010'>“The chief ground on which the advocates
for the Slave Trade rested their opinion (he
thinks) was, that God had formed some of
the human race inferior to others in intellect,
and that Negroes appeared to have been
intended for Slaves; or to that purpose.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Let this incident, and the conclusions which
it suggests, be well considered. It deserves
to have the more weight, on account both of
the understanding and character of the individual
who gave the account of it; for, no
man living was ever less likely to confound
any hasty expressions of men of warm and
feeling minds, or of men of speculation or
ingenuity, who might like to defend a paradox,
with the real deliberate judgment of men
of reflection, practical knowledge, and personal
experience. Observe, the only ground
on which the Slave Trade was defended, even
in Jamaica, was that of the Negroes being
an inferior species. This opinion, as I formerly
remarked, was the original foundation
of the Slave Trade, and it is the only ground
on which it can be rested with the smallest
<span class='pageno' id='Page_287'>287</span>pretence to reason, justice, or humanity.
Happily, the friends of these wretched beings
have, at length, obtained the recognition of
their human nature; but as yet it is a barren
and unprofitable right, if, while we grant them
to be men, we treat them as if we still
deemed them of an inferior species. But still
more this incident shews, that they, who,
from their local circumstances and pursuits
were most conversant with this great subject
in all it’s parts, had adopted, above thirty
years ago, the position which Mr. Pitt
asserted so confidently, and proved so unanswerably,
that the Slave Trade was contrary
not to justice and humanity only, but
to sound policy also; and if even so long ago
they entertained this opinion; what, if relieved
from the blinding effects of prejudice and
party, would be their judgment now, when all
the facts and principles, on which the Slave
Trade system must have been proved impolitic,
have received an almost unspeakable
accession of force, and when the arguments,
by which it’s policy could alone be contended
for, have since been almost entirely done
away: I regret that I have not time for enlarging
on this topic. But any man who has
obtained any insight into this question will
readily discern the several considerations to
which I allude.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The hope of West Indian body’s opposition ceasing.</div>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_288'>288</span>But notwithstanding I ascribe so much of
the opposition which has been made to us, to
the operation of party spirit, yet I dare not
hope that the flame is likely to become
weaker, or at length to die away. On the
contrary, there is a store of aliment fully sufficient
to maintain it in continual and even
interminable vigour. For after all that I have
stated, of it’s being rather the spirit of party,
or at the utmost a mistaken apprehension of
loss, than a just sense of interest, which animates
the efforts of the great mass of West
Indian Proprietors, yet there are many who,
it cannot be denied, are prompted by a true
persuasion that the abolition of the Slave
Trade will materially lessen their gains. Of
this number is that great, respectable, affluent,
and, as we have fatally experienced; most
powerful body, the West Indian Merchants.
I cannot deny that many, perhaps almost all
of this class, may have a direct interest in the
extension of West Indian cultivation. Though
planting speculations may not answer to the
immediate undertakers, they may answer to
the merchant in this country; and he might
gain by the cultivation being pushed to an
extent which would utterly ruin the planters.
He pays himself in the first instance both for
the articles furnished for the supply of the
estate, and for his profits on the importations
<span class='pageno' id='Page_289'>289</span>from abroad; and if he have prudence sufficient,
which however is seldom the case, to
prevent his advancing too much on any one
estate, so as to compel him to become the
proprietor of it, he is certainly engaged in an
advantageous branch of business. Hence he
is always the foremost to petition against the
abolition.</p>

<p class='c010'>Together with the merchants, I must except
also that considerable body, often of
respectable men, who have gone over to the
West Indian islands in inferior capacities,
and who mean to engage in planting undertakings.
The stoppage of the importations
from Africa would retard, at least, if not destroy
these speculations. This is a class of
men, in whose interests I confess I take a
lively interest; but not an interest sufficient
to induce me to sanction the destruction of
thousands of my fellow creatures annually,
for the sake of allowing them more convenient
opportunities of rising in life. I confess
their interest is a matter of much more concern
to me than those of the greater and
more adventurous speculators. I ought, perhaps,
also to except the last-mentioned class
of persons. Though, in common, to afford
them the opportunity of engaging in these
West Indian speculations, be only to afford
<span class='pageno' id='Page_290'>290</span>them an occasion of accomplishing their own
ruin; yet they conceive they have an interest
in the continuance of the Slave Trade, and
therefore they are not actuated only by party
spirit. This class is likely to increase. The
few great prizes in the West Indian lottery
will tempt adventurers to engage in it; and
it is in vain to hope that the colonists will ever
concur in the abolition of the Slave Trade,
so long as there is room left for new speculations;
that is, so long as there remains, in
the Western hemisphere, any unsettled land
capable of cultivation, and as any Negroes can
be brought from Africa to work it. So long
as there is any scope left for new speculations,
so long there will be a set of new speculators
residing in the islands, who will form the real
instigators of the opposition to the proposal for
abolishing the Slave Trade; and these, joined
by the great mercantile body at home, will
carry along with them the bulk of their brethren,
the colonial proprietors resident in this
country.</p>

<p class='c010'>It is for the benefit of these classes, not
for that of our old colonial proprietors, that
the Slave Trade is in reality carried on. For
it is undeniably true, nor will it, I presume, be
contested, that by far the larger proportion of
all the Slaves we import, have always been
<span class='pageno' id='Page_291'>291</span>and will ever be destined to the formation of
new settlements, not in maintaining and keeping
up estates which had been already completed.</p>

<p class='c010'>But surely the question has ere now occurred
to you, When or where is this system
to terminate? Is it to go on till our colonial
settlements are brought into a state of complete
cultivation? It may be worth while to
spend a few moments in examining the consequences
of such an admission; they were
traced out by a high authority, who stated,
that, even of the great island of Jamaica itself,
the quantity of uncultivated land was two-thirds
more than that already in cultivation.<a id='r47' /><a href='#f47' class='c011'><sup>[47]</sup></a>
To suffice for the cultivation of the other
parts, the complete number of 600,000 more
Negroes, living at the same time, would be
necessary, in addition to 256,000 now there.
The calculation went on to consider the numbers
which must be imported, and the length of
time which, under all the waste of human life
which attends the present destructive system,
must elapse, in bringing the Island of Jamaica
into complete cultivation by Slaves. It was
found that, supposing the rate at which the
cultivation and population would increase in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_292'>292</span>future, to be the same as that at which they
had increased hitherto, that it would not
be accomplished in less than two hundred and
twenty years, and it would require the exportation
from Africa of greatly more than a million
of our fellow creatures. For reasons which
could be stated, the period here mentioned is
much too short. But besides the Island of
Jamaica, there are St. Vincents, Grenada,
Dominica, above all, Trinidad, and the unknown
extent of our future continental acquisitions,
which would claim just the same
right to have their cultivation completed.</p>

<p class='c010'>Such must be admitted to be the fair consequences
of prosecuting the Slave Trade, for
the purpose, plainly enough avowed by the
colonists in Jamaica, of bringing into cultivation
the whole of the land which is still
uncultivated. Would even the most determined
friends of the West Indians on this
side of the water go this length? I speak not
of those, if any such there be, who love the
Slave Trade on account of its own inherent
excellencies; nor of the West Indian merchants,
nor yet of the African trader. But
would the less devoted friends of the Slave
Trade go the length of admitting this principle?
I trust they would not. Must they
not then concede, that the only principle on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_293'>293</span>which they can act consistently, must be that
of carrying on the importation of Slaves for the
sole purpose of keeping up, not of extending
the cultivation. Indeed, when this great
cause was argued in the House of Commons
in 1792, all, I believe, of our opponents, excepting
only those who were personally connected
with the Slave Trade, admitted fully
and frankly the principle of not opening new
lands. They objected not to the ground
which was taken by that great man to whom
I have already so often alluded. Would the
most attached friend, he asked, of the Slave
Trade, think of founding a new colony, or
of setting up a new Slave Trade? And it
was justly and undeniably argued, nor was the
position contested, that the formation of new
settlements in our old islands was just as much
the planting of a new colony, as if the same
settlements were made in any newly discovered
country. There was no difference in
principle between the two cases. It was a
new and voluntary establishment, made with
our eyes open to all the guilt which the enterprise
would involve, and all the horrors of
which we professed to be sensible. The force
of these arguments, when used in 1792, was
granted to be irresistible; but, as if it were in
absolute contempt of them, and of the practical
conclusions to which they lead, we are plainly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_294'>294</span>warned by the colonists, against supposing that
they will ever consent to stop the importations
from Africa, so long as any vacant and cultivable
land remains on which to plant them.
These facts, with the aweful considerations
which result from them, let me most seriously
urge on the conscientious deliberations of
those who, contrary alas! to the expectation
indulged by that great man whom I have
before so often mentioned; by their fatal proposal
of gradual, <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>The gradual abolitionists especially bound to consider these facts.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> instead of immediate abolition, dashed the cup of happiness from the lips of the wretched African, at the very moment when at last he appeared likely to taste it, and who thus proved in fact the most efficient supporters of the Slave Trade. A vast majority in Parliament were then so much alive to the principles of justice and
humanity, that all direct opposition would
have been utterly ineffectual. But this kind
of half measure, however unintentionally,
exactly answered the purpose of our enemies,
by giving time for the zeal of men to cool,
and providing an expedient by which, aided
by a little of that self deception which we are
all apt to practice on ourselves on suitable
occasions, they might feel the complacencies
arising from an act of justice and humanity,
without paying the price or making the sacrifice
which those principles required.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_295'>295</span>Let me be forgiven if I speak strongly,
where I feel so very deeply. It is not only
because the gradual Abolitionists have been,
in fact, the only real stay of that system of
wickedness and cruelty which we wish to
abolish; though that assertion is unquestionably
true; but it is trying beyond expression
that they should be the real maintainers
of the Slave Trade, who reprobate it in
terms of detestation as strong as any which
we ourselves can utter. Nor do I mean (the
declaration is made with solemnity and truth)
that these expressions are not sincere. If
they were not proved to be so by the general
character of those who use them, my personal
knowledge of some of them, and the esteem
and regard I entertain for them, excludes the
contrary supposition. Yet I cannot but believe,
that, could they have clearly foreseen
what would be the practical effect of their
opposition, it would not have been continued
for an hour.</p>

<p class='c010'>Let them now, however, remember the
grounds and principles on which they resisted
our measure; that they themselves stated
the question to be only between two different
modes of abolishing the Slave Trade. They
alleged, indeed, with others, the difficulty of
preventing Slaves being illicitly imported into
<span class='pageno' id='Page_296'>296</span>the colonies; but this was obviously an evil
which never could prevail to any great extent,
nor did they lay any considerable stress on it.
Abjuring the most remote idea of contending
for the interminable continuance of the Slave
Trade, the utmost they asked was, that a
short respite should be granted. The year
1800 was afterwards specifically named; the
West Indians would be able, in the interval,
to fill up their vacancies, to complete their
gangs; in short, to improve their population,
so as to be prepared to meet the new order
of things.</p>

<p class='c010'>But the gradual Abolitionists chiefly urged,
that we were too hasty and violent, and that
by our precipitancy we should defeat our own
purpose. For, without the concurrence of the
colonial legislatures, it was alleged, we could
not carry our measure into effect; they advised
that time, therefore, should be allowed
for softening the prejudices and cooling the
warmth of the colonists.</p>

<p class='c010'>What has followed since that period? The
Slave Trade, instead of eight, has now lasted
fourteen years. Far more time, therefore,
has been allowed the Planters for completing
their gangs, than was originally proposed by
any one who did not avow himself a friend
<span class='pageno' id='Page_297'>297</span>to the perpetuity of the Slave Trade. A far
greater number of Slaves, also, than was
then in any one’s contemplation, has since
been imported. So far, therefore, the Islands
are better prepared for the measure.</p>

<p class='c010'>But above all, it is now clear that we must
abandon all hopes of bringing the colonial
legislatures to consent cheerfully to the termination
of the Slave Trade. Was it possible
for the proposition to come before them,
not only in a more acceptable form, but with
a more gradual approach; and, if I may so
say, at the end of a longer visto, than when
it was presented to their notice by some of
the most respectable of their own body, by
men who had uniformly opposed the abolition
in the British Parliament, and when they had,
therefore, every reason to believe that the
importation of Slaves would never be actually
stopped until the measures, which were to
make that importation no longer necessary,
should have had, according to their own report,
an effect so complete and satisfactory as to
render the abolition no longer in the least
objectionable; yet so strong are the prejudices
of the colonists, that, even in answer to
this communication, they frankly declared
against abolition at any time and in any form.
They intimate plainly that they look forward
<span class='pageno' id='Page_298'>298</span>to the complete settlement of all the cultivable
but now waste land throughout the whole of
our West Indian islands.</p>

<p class='c010'>Supposing, therefore, that the gradual
Abolitionists even still retain their original
opinion, that the concurrence of the Colonists
is necessary to our complete success, yet considering
the immense magnitude, as acknowledged
by themselves, of the evil which all
this time has been going on with even increased
ravages; would it not be fair that they
should now, at least, consent to try the effect
of our less satisfactory measure? Would not
this be the mode of conduct pursued by men
in all the common affairs of life, when
really interested for the accomplishment
of any object? Supposing them to labour
under some painful or dangerous disease,
which was making havoc of their constitution,
and wearing them down with excruciating
torture, and that a particular plan of
treatment should be proposed to them;
supposing that, (though the plan should be recommended
by various medical men of the
most acknowledged superiority of skill, who,
though often differing, entirely agreed in this
particular, and prescribed with the most sanguine
confidence) they should yet fear the plan
would not answer, perhaps that it was in some
<span class='pageno' id='Page_299'>299</span>way or other impracticable; supposing them
also to prefer a second plan, recommended by
some other practitioner; yet if there appeared
to be in the way of the adoption of this second
plan some practical obstacle which they
could not remove, Would they suffer the disease
to go on with its ravages, rather than
adopt the first plan, from which they might
not themselves expect much benefit, but
which might yet be preferable to doing
nothing at all?</p>

<p class='c010'>But supposing, to make the case more
nearly parallel, that the disease was to have
continued for many years; that the proposers
of the first plan had declared from the very
first, that the second plan could not be carried
into execution; that time and other circumstances
had proved the truth of their prediction
as to the past, and that, to say the
least, the prospect was not brighter for the
future; would not a man thus circumstanced
be disposed at least to suspend his
opposition, and, if he could not give the
plan, which he still feared would be ineffectual,
his active support, yet would he not at
least cease to obstruct the trial of it, when
at the utmost he could only object that he
feared that the impracticability would be found
to attach to the first plan, which had been
<span class='pageno' id='Page_300'>300</span>proved by experience to belong to the
second?</p>

<p class='c010'>Are we not in public life continually compelled
to act on the principle of embracing
the measure which we do not, in itself, judge
to be near so eligible as another, which, from
it’s not appearing to others in the same light
as to us, is practically unattainable? And
was there ever an instance, if such an one
can possibly exist, in which this mode of proceeding
was so imperiously enforced on us
as in the present, when we consider to what
an extent the work of death is every year
going on in Africa: for here it may be
truly said, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Deliberat Roma, perit Saguntum</span></i>.</p>

<p class='c010'>Were I not convinced that the objection
against which I have been here contending was
urged by men of fair and honourable minds,
I should not have entered so largely into this
discussion. But with that persuasion, I cannot
but indulge the hope, that even though
their original objection may appear to them
to retain all it’s force, they will at least not
obstruct the trial of a measure which pleads
the authority of such respectable names, and
which affords the only practical hope, though
they may think it but a faint hope, of putting
an end to a system, which every year
<span class='pageno' id='Page_301'>301</span>that it lasts is producing, as they affirm not
less than we do, an almost incalculable amount
of misery.</p>

<p class='c010'>Let me also remind these gentlemen, that
if we immediate Abolitionists conceive them,
the gradual Abolitionists, to be, though unintentionally,
the real practical friends and
supporters of the Slave Trade, we at least are
not the only persons who hold that opinion.
The West Indians, who frankly declare they
never can consent to the abolition, nay even
the Slave Traders themselves, evidently shew
that they conceive these gradual Abolitionists
to be their real adherents.  Against them
ought to have been directed the serious opposition
of our African and West Indian opponents,
while we were mere objects of derision
and contempt. We were a set of well-meaning
visionaries, who were proposing
what, even if carried into effect, would be
found utterly impracticable. Whereas they
were men of sound practical understanding,
who had wisdom to devise effectual measures
for executing all which their virtue might
suggest. This is not urged with levity, it is
seriously and earnestly pressed. Nor is it a
statement without instruction. It has often
been justly urged, that we may collect much
as to the character of any man, or the tendency
<span class='pageno' id='Page_302'>302</span>of any measure, by observing them
not only in themselves, but, when that investigation
is difficult and doubtful, by observing
who are their enemies and who are their
friends. Tried by this principle at least, we
know what judgment would be passed on the
gradual Abolitionists.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Slave Trade injurious to our Marine.</div>

<p class='c010'>Another argument which, especially in
the outset of the discussion, was strongly, and
with great confidence, urged against us by
our opponents, was, that the African Trade
is a nursery for seamen; and that its abolition
would therefore be highly injurious to
our naval strength. This part of the subject
was very early taken up by Mr. Clarkson, a
gentleman whose services, throughout the
whole conduct of this great cause, deserve
the highest commendation. He asserted, as
the result of a long and laborious inquiry, that
of the sailors employed in the African Trade,
between a fifth and a sixth actually died; and
that the African ships seldom brought home
more than half of their original crews.
Nothing was more vehemently repelled, or
more obstinately denied, than these positions,
till, at length, having long borne with these
clamorous contradictions, the muster rolls of
the African ships were moved for and laid
before Parliament; documents which had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_303'>303</span>been kept in the possession of our opponents,
and which cannot therefore be supposed to
have been fabricated or coloured to serve our
purpose.</p>

<p class='c010'>From these papers Mr. Clarkson’s calculations
were fully justified. It appeared, that of
12,263 persons, the number of the original
crews, there had died 2,643, the average
length of their voyages being twelve months;
whilst, on the contrary, in the West Indian
trade, in which the length of the voyage was
seven months, of 7,640, the number of the
original crews, there had died only 118. But
the loss by deaths was not the whole loss to
the country; for, besides the broken constitutions
of the survivors, which rendered many
of them, for the rest of their lives, incapable
of the duties of their profession, so many left
their ships in consequence of ill usage, that
they seldom brought home more than half the
persons they had taken out. This last circumstance
was attempted to be accounted
for, from the natural capriciousness of sailors;
and it was said, that they ran away in as
great number from the West India as from
the Guinea ships. The direct contrary appeared
from the muster rolls, and this too,
though, from the different ways of paying
them in the two trades, their forfeiting little
<span class='pageno' id='Page_304'>304</span>or nothing by quitting the West Indiamen, but
much by quitting the Guineamen, the reverse
might have been naturally expected.
Much more might be said on this subject.
Especially, such scenes of cruelty towards those
unhappy men might be opened to your view,
as would excite at once the concern and indignation
of every man, who feels for that class
of his fellow-citizens to which this nation
owes so much both of her security, her affluence,
and her glory.</p>

<p class='c010'>The evidence taken before the House of
Commons contains but too many humiliating
instances of this kind; and in consequence we
find the most respectable naval commanders
acknowledging that the Slave Trade is no
nursery of seamen. This truth was even
frankly confessed by a Noble Admiral on whose
general testimony our opponents set the highest
value. But I will quit the present topic,
only remarking, that as at the outset of the
discussion none of our assertions was more
strongly controverted than that concerning the
loss of seamen, which can now be no longer
denied, we may hence claim some credit on
those points which are still in dispute. The
incident shows at least that it is not necessary
that our opponents should be correct in order
to be positive.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Another objection to abolition:—if we should abolish, foreign nations would still carry on the trade.</div>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_305'>305</span>Again, great stress was laid on the consideration,
that were Great Britain to desist
from the Slave Trade, other nations would
still continue it, and that the trade would
not therefore cease to exist. The only difference
would be, that the trade which formerly
we had ourselves carried on, would henceforth
be carried on by others; and how would
Africa, how would the cause of humanity, be
hereby a gainer? To this argument, many answers
were returned. But before I proceed
to state them, can I forbear remarking, that
there would have been no place for such an argument
as this, but for that fashionable though
pernicious doctrine of the present day, that we
are to regulate our practice by considerations
of expediency, that vague, fluctuating, and
often vicious instructress, instead of the sound,
plain, and immutable dictates of justice.
It is self-evident, that by stopping the importation
into our own colonies, we destroy
a large proportion at least of the evil.</p>

<p class='c010'>During the continuance of the war, all the
Dutch, and some of the French colonies,
being in our hands, the supply to such of the
French as are still unconquered being stopped,
that of the Spanish being much interrupted,
and the Portuguese settlements also deriving
their supply from the more southern part of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_306'>306</span>the Slave coast, the whole of that vast region
which constitutes what may be called the solid
substance of the African continent, would
be almost entirely exempt from the ravages
of the Slave Trade. Nor is this temporary
abolition desirable, merely in the view of its
affording to that wretched country a short
breathing time from her miseries. If the war
should be of any duration, we may hope, that
the Africans may form new habits, and, having
adopted less guilty expedients for obtaining
the commodities with which they are
supplied by the Europeans, may, in some
parts at least of the coast, not resume the
traffic in human beings, when the war shall
be at an end.</p>

<p class='c010'>All that could be said concerning the future
conduct in this relation, of France, Spain,
and Portugal, must be mere speculation. But,
let us ask, in regard to those several nations,
Where is the capital to be found? Surely
whatever might have been alleged formerly
concerning the possibility of British capital
being transported into foreign countries for
this use, it will scarcely now be urged; it
will surely at least not be credited, that in the
present state of the continent, any British
subjects will be mad enough, let their strange
and unnatural craving after this trade in flesh
<span class='pageno' id='Page_307'>307</span>and blood be ever so importunate, to trust
their capital in the way which this argument
supposes, out of the only country in which
either person or property can now be deemed
secure.</p>

<p class='c010'>We ought also to observe, that in both
the Spanish and Portuguese colonies, the
Slaves are far better treated, and the breeding
system much more encouraged, than in those
of the other European nations. There is in
them also far less of the spirit of commercial
speculation and enterprize than in our own.
Denmark has long since shewn her willingness
to abandon the Slave Trade, and private
information confirms the supposition which
the circumstances of the case suggest, that her
not having yet carried into full effect her declared
resolution, that the human traffic should
cease with the year 1800, may fairly be
ascribed to our conduct and example.</p>

<p class='c010'>The United States of America were absolutely
precluded, by a fundamental article of
the confederation, from abolishing the Slave
Trade before 1808, by any general law operating
over the whole of the union. But it
was one of the first acts of all, except I believe
one, of the individual states of which the union
consists, to abolish this traffic; and when a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_308'>308</span>law was lately passed in South Carolina, allowing
the importation of Slaves, Congress
shewed its sense of the transaction by imposing
on the importation of Slaves into
South Carolina itself, the highest duty which
the constitution permits. The importation of
Slaves also into Louisiana was entirely prohibited.
All these are strong indications of a
disposition in the Government of the United
States to abolish the Slave Trade; and they
confirm the assurance which has been received
from the best informed gentlemen of
that country, that in 1808, when Congress
will have a clear right to put an end to that
traffic, it will not be allowed the respite of an
hour.<a id='r48' /><a href='#f48' class='c011'><sup>[48]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>So far for the Slaves which are exported
westward from the coast of Africa. As to the
supply which is sent to the countries east of
Africa, it has long been comparatively trifling
in amount; and by far the larger part of
those immense regions which furnish the European
exports, are too distant to allow of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_309'>309</span>Slaves being carried out of them eastward to
a profit.</p>

<p class='c010'>But may we not be allowed to assume a
higher tone, and to ask, if this practice,
though by a strange perversion of words it is
called the Slave Trade, ought indisputably to
be considered as a most enormous crime, rather
than a commerce, is it not clearly our
own duty to abstain from it, and to prohibit
and to punish the perpetration of it by our
own subjects, however it may still prevail in
other countries?</p>

<p class='c010'>It might serve to discover the monstrous
tendencies of this argument, to those whose
moral principle is so dull and dark as not instinctively
to reject it, to consider to what
lengths it might fairly carry them: for why
might it not equally be alleged as a sufficient
plea for performing every other act of profitable
wickedness, which we might conceive,
though perhaps unjustly, would be performed
by others if not by ourselves. Let any one
consider what would be the consequences of
admitting such a principle into the intercourse
of nations.</p>

<p class='c010'>Is this, then, a principle to which we will
give our solemn sanction, unless we mean
<span class='pageno' id='Page_310'>310</span>fairly to avow that we have one set of religious
and moral principles for Africa, and
another for the rest of the world?</p>

<p class='c010'>Apply the principle to private life, and
consider what would be its consequences.
But there happily the law of the land would
soon interfere to check its application. And
here, indeed, from first to last, is our misfortune
in this whole business of the Slave
Trade; that the practices, for the abolition
of which we are contending, are such, as by
the laws of every civilized community are
punishable with death; but, unhappily, there
is no tribunal (no earthly tribunal) to which
the criminals are amenable. And is this
a time above all others, and are the present
circumstances of nations precisely those in
which such a principle of conduct becomes
the Imperial Parliament of Great Britain?
Or, if the reproach which has been cast against
us be really true, and we are only to be
moved by an appeal to our self-interest, is
this a time when it is politic or even safe to
avow such a principle, and to inculcate such
a lesson?</p>

<p class='c010'>But how, it was indignantly asked, could
this enormous evil be ever eradicated, if
every nation were thus prudentially to wait
<span class='pageno' id='Page_311'>311</span>till the concurrence of all other nations
should be obtained? Let it also be remembered
that, on the one hand, no nation has
plunged so deeply into this guilt as Great
Britain; on the other, that none could be so
likely to be looked up to as an example, if she
should be the first decidedly to renounce it.</p>

<p class='c010'>But does not this very argument, grounded
on the probable conduct of other nations,
apply a thousand times more strongly in a
contrary direction? How much more reasonably
might other nations point to us, and say,
Why should we abolish the Slave Trade,
when Great Britain has not abolished?
Great Britain, free, just, and honourable as
she is, deeply also involved as she is in this
commerce above all other nations, not only
has not abolished, but has refused to abolish!
(This was the language of a great man, many
years ago). Alas! it may now be added, and
after even at length resolving to abolish, has
receded from her resolution!</p>

<p class='c010'>A long and scrutinizing inquiry has taken
place, the subject has been thoroughly canvassed.
Her Senate has deliberated again
and again; and what is the result? She has
gravely and solemnly determined to sanction
the Slave Trade. Her Legislature therefore
<span class='pageno' id='Page_312'>312</span>is doubtless convinced that it has been falsely
charged with injustice, cruelty, and impolicy.
What need then have we to look any further?
Why should we examine or deliberate?
What more satisfactory proofs could
our own investigation bring forth, of the justice
and policy of the Slave Trade?</p>

<p class='c010'>Thus, then, it would appear, on a more
impartial view, that, instead of being justified
in our continuing to prosecute the Slave
Trade, by the probability that other nations
would still carry it on, we with but too much
colour of reason may be charged with being,
if not the authors, yet at least the confirmers
of their disposition to persevere in it; and
to our account may at last appear to be in a
great measure imputable the entire mass of
the guilt of this enormous wickedness. We
cannot, it is to be feared, now undo all the
evil which our misconduct has occasioned;
but, as we have long been foremost in the
crime, let us, however tardily, endeavour to
be at length exemplary in our repentance.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Slave Trade supported on grounds of justice.</div>

<p class='c010'>Of all the sources whence arguments
could be drawn in support of the Slave
Trade, that of justice would perhaps least
have been anticipated by those who have
seen how from first to last it sets at nought
<span class='pageno' id='Page_313'>313</span>the rights and happiness of our fellow creatures.
The argument was put, however,
with some plausibility, so as on a very superficial
view to appear to have a faint
colour of equity. It was argued, that we
had encouraged the West Indians to engage
in colonial speculations; that these speculations
could not be carried on without supplies
from time to time of African labourers;
that therefore, to prohibit the importation
of Negroes, was to ensure the failure of
those very speculations into which we had
encouraged the West Indians to embark.</p>

<p class='c010'>It was a sufficient reply, that if the West
Indians would but reform the glaring abuses
of their system of management, abuses to
which not only every humane but every just
mind must be anxious to put an end; importations
of Slaves from Africa would be
rendered perfectly unnecessary, by the natural
increase of their domestic stock; while
from the stopping of these importations, various
and highly important advantages would
follow, to the West Indians themselves as well
as to the empire at large. But supposing the
case to have been otherwise, and that the
West Indians might be likely to suffer in
their property from our abolition of the
Slave Trade; the inference suggested by justice,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_314'>314</span>I say not by self-interest, but by justice,
would be, that the West Indians should be
compensated out of the treasury of the mother
country, or rather, that the loss should
fall in equal shares on all the several parties.
But for justice to be supposed to inculcate,
that because (from our being ignorant, it is to
be hoped, of the real nature and effects of the
Slave Trade) we had been accustomed to
ravage the unprotected shores of Africa, and
bring away by force a number of innocent
men, women, and children, to carry them
in the hold of a Slave ship in fetters, across
the Atlantic, and consign the survivors and
their descendants for ever to a state of hopeless
and most degraded bondage;—to argue,
that, because for two centuries we had pursued
this course of wickedness and cruelty, or
because, which is not fact, we had even
engaged to continue it—that we are bound
by the obligation of duty to admit the equity
of such a prescription, or to fulfil such an
engagement, is certainly a most extraordinary
lesson for justice to be supposed to
inculcate.</p>

<p class='c010'>Supposing us to be the debtors of the
West Indians, what right have we, as was
so well urged by my excellent friend, Mr.
Gisborne, to pay British debts with the flesh
<span class='pageno' id='Page_315'>315</span>and blood of Africans? The absurdity of
this argument, not to mention its profane
usurpation of the sacred name of justice, is
too manifest to require any further comment.</p>

<p class='c010'>But it may be proper in this place to say a
few words concerning compensation. It was
stated by the great minister to whom I have
so often had occasion to allude, than whom no
one was more intimately conversant with the
commercial system of this country, that it had
been our general practice to make from time to
time such regulations in the different branches
of our commerce, as considerations of policy or
finance might require; and excepting cases in
which the circumstances had been peculiar,
it had not been usual to grant compensation
to those who might suffer from the change.
The abolition of the Slave Trade ought therefore
to be regarded as one of the contingencies
which are foreseen and understood in
general, though not in the particular form and
instance in which they may happen; one of
those accidents to which persons who engage
in commercial or any other speculations render
themselves liable, relying only on the wisdom
and justice of the legislature, that, in administering
its important trust of watching over the
general welfare of the community, it will, as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_316'>316</span>far as possible, consult also the advantage of
every particular class, and not lightly sacrifice
any individual interests.</p>

<p class='c010'>The truth of this doctrine was completely
established by the great man above referred
to, who contended, founding his arguments on
general reasoning, and confirming them by a
reference to particular statutes, that Parliament
had at no time given any pledge that
the Slave Trade should be continued, or that
the losses incurred in consequence of its suppression,
had any losses been likely to take
place, should be made good by the public.</p>

<p class='c010'>Still as it might seem hard, if not absolutely
unjust, that one set of men should be the sufferers,
when the crime, though committed
chiefly for their benefit, was one in which
others had participated with them, it was declared
by the chancellor of the exchequer,
that one class of persons, those alone who
might otherwise with reason complain of hard
measure, if not of unjust treatment, should
receive compensation on any fair case of injury
being made out to the satisfaction of impartial
commissioners. This was the class of persons
who had bought lots of uncultivated land of
Government, in the ceded or any other islands.
It might be presumed, that they had engaged
<span class='pageno' id='Page_317'>317</span>in the speculation, with expectations of being
able to bring them into cultivation by imported
Africans; and therefore if they had performed
their share of the conditions of the purchase,
they were entitled to require the state to perform
its share also, or to pay them an equivalent.</p>

<p class='c010'>But when the colonial system, as now
administered, except perhaps in some particular
cases, has not only been injurious to
the Slaves, but on the long run to the master
also; when it is at length declared by a
very intelligent West Indian, that the colonists,
by adopting those reforms for which
justice and humanity should alone furnish sufficient
motives, will ultimately derive the
most substantial benefits, though possibly they
may suffer some temporary inconveniency;
when, at the same time, the prejudices against
these reforms are so powerful, that a direct,
palpable, and valuable interest alone, will probably
be adequate to overcome their effect;
in such circumstances as these, it is undeniably
obvious, that to hold forth an offer of compensation
to all, who, after the abolition, should
allege that they had suffered from that measure,
or who should even furnish plausible proof
that it had been injurious to their interests,
would not only be to subject ourselves to immeasurable
<span class='pageno' id='Page_318'>318</span>and most inequitable claims, but
would be to interpose an insurmountable obstacle
in the way of all reforms of the West
Indian system, or, to speak more correctly,
it would be to give a premium on the continuance
and even extension of the old abuses.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>and on grounds of religion.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> It is, however, most of all astonishing, that our opponents attempt to vindicate the Slave Trade on grounds of religion also. The only argument which they urge with the slightest colour of reason is, that slavery was allowed under the Jewish dispensation. The Jews were exalted by the express designation of heaven to a state of eminence above the strangers
who sojourned among them, and the
heathen who dwelt around them, from either
of whom, as a mark of their own dominion,
God, who has a right to assign to all his creatures
their several places in the scale of being,
allowed them to take bondmen and bondwomen,
treating them, however, with kindness,
remembering their own feelings when
they were slaves in Egypt, and admitting them
to the chief national privileges, to the circumcision,
to the passover, and other solemn feasts,
and thus instructing them in the true religion.
Besides this, the slaves were to be set free at
the year of Jubilee, or every fiftieth year, a
command which was alone sufficient to prevent
their accumulating in any great number.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_319'>319</span>But they who thus urge on us the Divine
toleration of slavery under the Jewish Theocracy,
should remember that the Jews themselves
were expressly commanded not to
retain any of <em>their own nation</em>, any of their
<em>brethren</em> in slavery, except as a punishment,
or by their own consent; and even these
were to be set free on the return of the
sabbatical, or the seventh year. Inasmuch
therefore, as we are repeatedly and expressly
told that Christ has done away all distinctions
of nations, and made all mankind one
great family, all our fellow creatures are now
our brethren; and therefore the very principles
and spirit of the Jewish law itself would
forbid our keeping the Africans, any more than
our own fellow subjects, in a state of slavery.
But even supposing, contrary to the fact,
that our opponents had succeeded in proving
that the Slave Trade was not contrary to
the Jewish law, this would only prove that
they would be entitled to carry it on if they
were Jews, and could, like the Jews, produce
satisfactory proof that they were the chosen
people of God. But really it would be consuming
your time to no purpose, to enter
into a formal proof, that fraud, rapine, and
cruelty, as<a id='t319'></a> contrary to that religion, which
commands us to love our neighbour as ourselves,
and to do to others as we would have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_320'>320</span>them do to us. I cannot persuade myself
that our opponents are serious in using this
argument, and therefore I will proceed no
farther with this discussion. Besides, even
granting that it were possible for any of
them to be seriously convinced that Christianity
does not prohibit the Slave Trade, I
should still have no great encouragement to
proceed, for,—it may be prejudice, but I cannot
persuade myself that they are so much
under the practical influence of religion,
that if we should convince their understandings,
we should alter their conduct. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Other Considerations which enforce the necessity of abolition.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> After having thus stated the various grounds on which our opponents argued against the abolition of the Slave Trade, it still however remains for me to mention two or three additional considerations. For want of time I shall not dwell long on them. But let me recommend them to your most serious reflection,
for they are of unspeakable importance.
It is not using too strong language to
affirm, that if all the arguments which have
been hitherto adduced in support of the abolition
of the Slave Trade, were weak and
unsatisfactory, the measure is urged on us by
these considerations alone, with such commanding
force, that it would deserve the
name of infatuation not to agree to it, and
that on grounds not merely of abstract right
<span class='pageno' id='Page_321'>321</span>and duty, but of regard for the well-being
of our West Indian Colonies themselves, and
for the prosperity of the British Empire.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Insurrections:—danger of.</div>

<p class='c010'>The first consideration which I shall mention
is that of a danger of unspeakable amount,
to which at length, though surely somewhat
too late, even those who have been most
blinded by prejudice begin to open their eyes.
It seems at last to be discovered, that Negroes
are men; that as men, they are subject to
human passions; that they can feel when
they are injured; that they can conceive,
and meditate, and mature; can combine and
concert, and at length proceed to execute
with vigour what they have planned with
policy. Such being the lesson which the
Island of St. Domingo has taught to those
most unwilling to receive it; the immense
disproportion between the Blacks and Whites
in our islands, perhaps ten or even fifteen
to one, is a subject of most just and serious
dread, and the danger is extremely aggravated,
by the difference between the two
descriptions being so plain and palpable, that
the more numerous body is continually reminded
of its own force. What but insanity
would go on every year augmenting a disproportion
already so great!</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_322'>322</span>But it is highly important also to consider,
that the continuance of the Slave Trade not
only aggravates the danger of the West Indian
settlements, by increasing the disproportion
between Blacks and Whites, but still more by
introducing that very description of persons
which has been acknowledged by the most
approved West Indian writers to be most
prone to insurrections.  Here let us refer
again to the historian of Jamaica.  “The
truth is,” says he, “that ever since the
introduction of Africans into the West
Indies, insurrections have occurred in every
one of the colonies, British as well as foreign,
at times.”<a id='r49' /><a href='#f49' class='c011'><sup>[49]</sup></a> Again, “The vulgar
opinion in England confounds all the Blacks
in one class, and supposes them equally
prompt for rebellion; an opinion that is
grossly erroneous. The Negroes who have
been chief actors in the seditions and mutinies
which at different times have broken
out here, were the imported Africans.”<a id='r50' /><a href='#f50' class='c011'><sup>[50]</sup></a>
Again; “If insurrections should happen
oftener in Jamaica than in the smaller
islands, it would not be at all surprising;
since it has generally contained more Negroes
than all the windward British islands
<span class='pageno' id='Page_323'>323</span>taken together: its importations in some
years have been very great:</p>

<table class='table1' summary=''>
  <tr>
    <td class='c006'>In 1764 imported,</td>
    <td class='c007'>10,223</td>
  </tr>
  <tr><td>&nbsp;</td></tr>
  <tr>
    <td class='c006'>And from January 1765 to July 1766, a year and a half,</td>
    <td class='c007'>16,760</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p class='c015'>“So large a multitude as 27,000 introduced in
the space of two years and a half, furnishes
a very sufficient reason, if there was no
other, to account for plots and mutinies.”<a id='r51' /><a href='#f51' class='c011'><sup>[51]</sup></a>
Let it be remembered, that since Mr. Long’s
book was published, in 1774, there have been
retained probably above 200,000 Negroes;
and add to these the importations which have
subsequently taken place in our other islands,
and remember, that, as even Negroes can confederate,
and the Slaves in the several islands
might mutually assist each other, all the
islands are interested; that fresh accessions of
Negroes should not be permitted in any one:
then estimate if you can the sum of the danger
which has been too long suffered to accumulate
without restraint, and which is every
year still increasing.</p>

<p class='c010'>Even at the very moment in which I am
writing, I hear rumours of an insurrection in
one of our smaller colonies, Grenada; and
though I cannot trace the report to any authentic
source, yet it is impossible to deny
<span class='pageno' id='Page_324'>324</span>that it is highly probable. The importations
into this island have been of late years larger,
considering its size, than into most of our
other islands; thence the report derives additional
probability. But to all the foregoing
considerations, add that new aggravation of
the dangers of our West Indian colonies, that,
almost within the visible horizon of our
largest island, the Negroes have been taught
but too intelligibly the fatal secret of their
own strength. Here also the Planters may
learn, were it not before abundantly clear,
how ardent is the Negroes’ love of liberty, and
what a price they are willing to pay for it.
The season is critical—not a moment is to
be lost. The British Legislature should consider
the present as a happy interval, in
which, perhaps, an opportunity is yet providentially
afforded them, of averting the gathering
storm. If they pause, it will be too
late.</p>

<p class='c010'>Let it not be said, that the West Indians
themselves can best judge of the reality of
the danger, and that they do not greatly regard
it. It might, indeed, have been expected,
that the necessity of compulsion would
here be superseded by every man’s concern
for his own interest and safety. But that takes
place in this case, which often happens where
<span class='pageno' id='Page_325'>325</span>danger is apprehended to the whole community,
from practices in which men engage
for their own individual advantage.
Each particular instance of this practice
seems to add but little to the amount of the
general danger, or but little in proportion to
the advantage which the individual expects to
derive from it. The danger besides is uncertain,
however probable; and he shares it in
common with the whole community. The
benefit he conceives certain, and the gain is
all his own. Is not this then precisely the
state of circumstances in which the legislature
should interfere as the general guardian
of the whole community, and prevent the interest
and happiness of all from being endangered
by individual avarice, obstinacy, or foolhardiness.
But it would not be wonderful
if the resident West Indians themselves were
not conscious on what hollow ground they
stand. It is nothing new that they who are
most exposed to a great danger are the least
aware of it; that, like the short-sighted inhabitants
of Puzzoli, or Terra del Gréco,
they alone are insensible to the approaching
lava which is about to desolate their dwellings.
It happens in this, as in other instances,
familiarity with the danger naturally
generates insensibility to it, and the very persons
who are most exposed to its evils, are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_326'>326</span>most blind to its reality and magnitude. But
the legislature, as a provident guardian of the
whole community, should exercise its watchful
superintendence, and take that step which
is the natural preliminary to all radical reform,
and to all effectual measures for the
future safety of the islands. But, to state the
truth, it is not merely by familiarity with the
great danger which we have been describing,
that the resident colonists are rendered insensible
to it. This insensibility results in no
small degree from the extreme degradation
of the Negro race. The resident White is so
accustomed to regard them as of an inferior
species, that he is no more apprehensive lest
they should learn the fatal secret of their own
strength, and combine for their own deliverance,
than lest such a combination should
take place among the horses or cattle, or any
other inferior animals, which may therefore,
without danger, be suffered to increase their
numbers to any amount.<a id='r52' /><a href='#f52' class='c011'><sup>[52]</sup></a> Is it possible to see
<span class='pageno' id='Page_327'>327</span>men thus lulled into a fatal insensibility to
such a great and obvious danger, without recognizing
once more that righteous ordination
of the Almighty, by which, when human
laws are inactive, he provides natural punishment
of our infringement on the rights and
happiness of our fellow creatures.</p>

<p class='c010'>But the dangers to our great island of
Jamaica, arising out of its proximity to St.
Domingo, are not yet exhausted. Contemplate
the state of St. Domingo. See how it is
placed; almost in contact with Jamaica.
Consider its size, and its vast Black population.
And since recent events have so clearly
proved that Negroes can reason, and feel and
act like ourselves; we may form no unjust
judgment of the probable sentiments and
emotions of these free Negroes, by imagining
what in similar circumstances would be our
own.</p>

<p class='c010'>Take then the Negroes of St. Domingo,
justly jealous of the Europeans, and resolved
carefully to watch over and defend those
newly-acquired liberties which they have so
dearly purchased. They hear of cargoes of
their wretched countrymen continually torn
from their native land, and doomed for life to
a state of vassalage. They see that, all
<span class='pageno' id='Page_328'>328</span>around them, their African countrymen are
still detained in that same state of bitter
bondage from which they have themselves so
lately emerged. They know that the Colonists
in all the islands regard them with
mixed emotions of hatred and fear, and
would rejoice in being able again to rivet on
their chains. Do they not see, in the present
degraded state of their brethren, and remember
in their own, that there is a grand
fundamental ground of distinction between
Blacks and Whites, a radical separation and
even opposition of interests; a real, enduring
principle of hostility?</p>

<p class='c010'>May they not reasonably be supposed to
think that they owe it alike to their honour
and their security to vindicate the rights of
their sable countrymen? May they not apprehend,
that if they do not, while they can,
assist their brethren in the neighbouring colonies
to assert their freedom, and drive out
their taskmasters, the white inhabitants of
the other islands will not only preserve their
empire over the Blacks already subject to
them, but be continually plotting for the destruction
of freedom in St. Domingo? May
they not justly fear lest the European Powers,
when their present differences shall be made
up, should hereafter combine their efforts to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_329'>329</span>restore, even in St. Domingo itself, the yoke
of slavery?</p>

<p class='c010'>Such, it is not unnatural to suppose, will
be the reasonings and sensations of the
St. Domingo Negroes. But experience has
in vain afforded us proofs of the watchfulness,
address, and versatility of our indefatigable
enemy, if we do not suppose it
possible that Bonaparte, by his agents, will
reinforce those natural surmises; that by
suggesting, through his emissaries, to the
Negroes of St. Domingo, the dangers to
which they are exposed, and the means of
averting them, he will endeavour to stimulate
them to invade Jamaica, and to stir up in all
our islands insurrection and revolt. Those
whom he has in vain attempted to make the
victims of his rapacity, he will thus render
the instruments of his revenge.</p>

<p class='c010'>Let any one read the “Crisis of our Sugar
Colonies” with seriousness, and he will acknowledge
the amount, the variety, the probability,
of the dangers to which our West
Indian settlements are exposed. Their reality
as well as their magnitude must equally be
confessed by every man whose judgment is
not totally obscured by interest, or whose discernment
<span class='pageno' id='Page_330'>330</span>is not altogether blinded by familiarity
with the objects which he views.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Our population drained.</div>

<p class='c010'>The next of the important topics to which
I lately alluded is one on which, from prudential
motives, I will press lightly; but which I
must commend to the most serious attention
of my readers, not merely from considerations
of humanity, but even of self-interest.
The West Indies have long been regarded as
the grave of our soldiers and seamen, but
never surely with so much reason as of late
years. For a new disease has broken out, so
terribly wasteful in its effects, and so little
subject hitherto to the controul of medicine,
as to furnish too just cause for fearing lest
there should be such a constant drain of
the population of the mother country, as from
the numbers consumed on the one hand, perhaps
even still more on the other, from the
dangerous effects on our naval and military
service (I trust I shall be understood, though,
from motives of caution, I rather hint than
express my meaning) to render the protection
of our transatlantic colonies incompatible with
our internal security. This is a topic on
which I will not press; but in proportion as I
abstain from the alarming discussion, lest I
should in any degree aggravate one of the
evils which I apprehend, let it be deeply and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_331'>331</span>seriously weighed by every considerate mind.
Even independently of interest, shall not
the voice of humanity be heard? Is it nothing
to send the brave defenders of our
country, and the flower of our youth, to a
pestilential climate, where they fall not in the
field of battle, not contending with the enemies
of their country, but where they perish
unknown, and therefore ingloriously, often
even falling the victims of their own fears,
from beholding such multitudes around them
continually swept away.<a id='r53' /><a href='#f53' class='c011'><sup>[53]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>But that which I must press upon you is,
that all these sufferers, or at least an immense
majority of them, are the victims of the Slave
Trade. For it is this pernicious traffic,
which by the double operation of continually
increasing the disproportion between the
Blacks and Whites on the one hand, and
of obstructing on the other those salutary
reforms which would change by degrees this
depraved, degraded mass into a happy peasantry;
makes you shrink back with terror
from defending the islands by their own
internal resources, though we cannot but
acknowledge that they would hereby be
rendered utterly invincible by any European
<span class='pageno' id='Page_332'>332</span>force which the great nation, or any others
of our enemies, might bring against them.<a id='r54' /><a href='#f54' class='c011'><sup>[54]</sup></a>
And here a fresh prospect of misery opens
to our view: here come in a new set of
sufferers from the Slave Trade, not the less
to be attended to, because, as yet at least,
they do not themselves trace the bitter stream
from which their cup is filled, to its original
source; the numerous train of widows and
orphans and relatives, whose nearest connections
have fallen the victims of the diseases
of the western world. I am persuaded,
that if the full effect of the Slave
Trade in this relation were generally known,
the general feelings of the nation, more
powerfully, alas! excited for our own subjects
than for the unhappy Africans, would have
produced throughout the British Isles one
universal cry of indignation against this arch
enemy of the happiness of mankind. Here
is another of those instances, several of which
in the course of this investigation we have had
occasion to remark, wherein, through the righteous
retribution of Heaven, wickedness and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_333'>333</span>cruelty are not allowed, even in this world, to
go unpunished; by which the irreligious and
unfeeling are taught to respect the happiness
of others, if from no higher motive, yet from
regard to the preservation of their own.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Summary view of the miseries produced by the Slave Trade.</div>

<p class='c010'>And now surely you must be prepared to
admit without hesitation, and in its full extent,
the declaration made by Mr. Pitt in the
House of Commons, that the Slave Trade
was the greatest practical evil that ever had
afflicted the human race.  Such indeed it
would be found, had we but leisure to take the
real weight of all the various evils which
it includes; and surely it might well become
us to enter into this examination. But it
would almost exceed the powers of calculation,
after having traced the Slave Trade into
all its various forms of suffering, to estimate
the amount of them all.</p>

<p class='c010'>Let us, however, spend a few moments in
adding up the great totals of which it consists,
that we may be the less likely to deceive
ourselves, as in such cases men are apt
to do, by underrating the evils of which we
are the cause, and consequently the amount
of guilt with which we are chargeable.</p>

<p class='c010'>To begin with Africa. If we would form
<span class='pageno' id='Page_334'>334</span>a fair calculation of the aggregate sum of
misery caused by the Slave Trade, we must
remember that it is by no means to be estimated
by the numbers which we actually
carry away into slavery: Nor yet by adding
to them all the wretched relatives, families,
and connections who are left behind: Nor
yet by superadding the devastation and misery
which, to those who may not actually be
caught and carried off, may arise from all
the several predatory expeditions occasioned
by the Slave Trade, either directly or in
retaliation of former aggressions originating
from the same cause: Nor still by adding
the destruction and desolation produced by
national wars (for of these the Slave Trade
is often the origin), with pestilence and
famine, and all the various forms of misery
which follow war in its train: Nor even
yet by subjoining the wretchedness of those,
with all their families and friends, who are
the victims of injustice and treachery, masking
themselves under the forms of law, or availing
themselves of the native superstitions.</p>

<p class='c010'>But let us endeavour to make the case
our own, and to consider what it would be
to live in a country subject to such continual
depredations by night, and such treachery by
day. These evils affect the whole condition
<span class='pageno' id='Page_335'>335</span>of society; they poison the happiness of every
family, nay, it may almost be said of every
individual in the community. All the nameless
but sweet enjoyments comprised within
the idea of home, to all of which security is
necessary, are at once destroyed; and Parke
assures us that no people taste these pleasures
with a higher relish than the Negroes.</p>

<p class='c010'>Consider the intensity of the sufferings
which the Slave Trade occasions in Africa,
and the number of the sufferers; remember
throughout what an immense extent these
evils prevail, and the time they have continued.</p>

<p class='c010'>To this vast mass of African misery, add
up all the various evils of the middle passage.
See there the husband and father, wife
and mother, who have been torn from the
dearest objects of their affections, and are now
carried away, they know not whither, in their
floating prison. Take in, their never having
been before at sea, their confinement, their
posture, with all the other distressing particulars
of their situation; is not too much
to say that you see them enduring exquisite
bodily suffering. But, much more, consider
the sorrows of the mind; see them dying of
a broken heart, from the loss of their friends
<span class='pageno' id='Page_336'>336</span>and country, from their remembrance of the
past, and their prospect for the future. In
this state forced to bear the coarse brutality
of the sailors, and urged by stripes, with a
stomach loathing food, to eat; and with limbs
galled with fetters, to dance; while their
hearts are wrung with agony. Consider then
that in every individual Slave ship there are
most likely multitudes of these wretched beings;
many of them men, as Mr. Parke tells
us, of some education; some of them men of
considerable rank in their own country: but
the whole cargo, as it is hatefully termed, consists
of husbands and wives, of parents and
children—all had a home—all had relatives.</p>

<p class='c010'>But to the sufferings of the wretched
Slaves themselves, we must add those of the
sailors also, who are too often treated with
extreme barbarity. Of the latter, there are
not a few who, though their lives are spared,
lose their health, their sight, or the use of
their limbs, not merely from the unwholesome
nature of the climate of Africa, but
from various peculiarities attendant on the
Slave Trade.</p>

<p class='c010'>Nor ought we to omit the moral injury
which our country sustains from the number
of persons who are rendered ferocious and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_337'>337</span>unfeeling by the hardening nature of their
constant occupation.</p>

<p class='c010'>It would be difficult to add up the different
items, much less to discover the precise sum
of the misery which may fairly be placed to
the account of the Slave Trade in the West
Indies. Here, however, let me first remark,
and it ought to have been observed in the case
of Africa likewise, the Slave Trade is justly
chargeable with the prevention of all that domestic
happiness and social comfort and
prosperity which would follow from the introduction
of the domestic system which it naturally
supersedes. But when we proceed to
the positive articles of this account; when
we endeavour to sum up the total of the
immense number of individual sufferers:
Again, when to these we add the sufferings
and the waste of our brave defenders, by
sea and land, with the sorrows of their surviving
relatives; and when we consider the
unknown amount of evil, which, from the
effect on the minds of our soldiers and
sailors, may at some time or other result
from this class of ravages, evil possibly commensurate
with the ruin of our country:
When we remember that it is the Slave Trade
which prolongs the internal weakness of our
West Indian colonies, that it is this weakness
<span class='pageno' id='Page_338'>338</span>which invites attack, and thence creates the
necessity of defence at such a profuse expenditure
of the lives of our countrymen; and
that the facility of conquering these possessions
operates powerfully as a temptation to our
enemies to commence war, with all its unknown
miseries and dangers: By what new
denomination shall we in any degree fairly
express the real sum of these several items?</p>

<p class='c010'>There is still, however, another class of
evils on which I have occasionally touched,
which will appear of the highest amount to
all considerate men, to whom the best interests
of their country are dear, and who
have been accustomed to trace the operation
of those causes which have led to the decline
and fall of nations.<a id='r55' /><a href='#f55' class='c011'><sup>[55]</sup></a> These are the moral
evils both of the Slave Trade, and even, still
more, because of greater extent, of the system
of West Indian slavery. It is the fashion of
the present day to pay little attention to evils
<span class='pageno' id='Page_339'>339</span>of this class; but they are not on this account
less real or less efficient. Their nature and
force have been acknowledged by all writers
of eminence, whether ancient or modern,
who have treated either of the prosperity or
decay of the great nations of antiquity.</p>

<p class='c010'>The system of slavery, especially of slavery
in it’s more hateful forms, never did nor
ever will prevail long in any country, without
producing a most pernicious effect, both on
it’s morals, habits, and manners. This is an
invidious topic, on which I will not enlarge;
but let it’s amount be duly estimated
by all who are interested for the independence,
the prosperity, or the happiness of their
country. When all these various masses of
misery are piled up into one, who shall attempt
to take the dimensions of it’s enormous
bulk. Yet we must acknowledge, that from
it’s very size it produces less impression on
mankind in general. This principle may be
termed a law of our nature, and we suffer
from the effect of it in every part of our great
cause. I firmly believe that it is here the
Slave Trade has found it’s chief security.
Had it not been for the operation of this cause,
both Houses of Parliament, I had almost said
the whole nation, would have risen with one
indignant effort, and have forced the Slave
<span class='pageno' id='Page_340'>340</span>Traders to desist from their cruel occupation.
Could we but place even the people of Liverpool
themselves, where they could see with
their own eyes the progress, from first to last,
of this series of crimes and cruelties; could
we but confine their attention so that they
might have but one object before them at
once, and might view it in all it’s parts distinctly,
with all it’s circumstances and relations,
I firmly believe they would themselves
abjure that inhuman traffic for which they are
now so ignominiously preeminent.</p>

<p class='c010'>But the enormous dimensions of this mass
of misery are such, that our organs are not
fitted for the contemplation of it; our affections
are not suited to deal with it; we are
lost in the immensity of the prospect; we are
distracted by it’s variety. We may see highly
probable reasons why our all wise Creator has
so constituted us, that we are more deeply
affected by one single tale of misery, with all
the details of which we are acquainted, than
by the greatest accumulation of sufferings of
which the particulars have not fallen under
our notice. Could I but separate this immense
aggregate into all its component parts, and
present them one by one to your view, in all
their particularity of wretchedness, you would
then have a more just impression of the immensity
<span class='pageno' id='Page_341'>341</span>of the misery which we wish to
terminate. This cannot now be done; but
let us, in concluding our melancholy course,
employ a few moments in taking some family,
or some individual Negro, and following him
through all his successive stages of suffering,
from his first becoming the victim of
some nightly attack on his dwelling, or from
his being sentenced to slavery for the benefit
of those who condemned him, to the final
close of his wretched life. I will not attempt
to describe his sufferings; estimate from your
own feelings what must be his, in all the
various situations through which he passes.</p>

<p class='c010'>Conceive, if you can, the agony with which,
as he is hurried away by his unfeeling captors,
he looks back upon the native village
which contains his wife and children who
are left behind; or, supposing them to have
been carried off also, with which he sees
their sufferings, and looks forward to the
dreadful future; while his own anguish is
augmented by witnessing theirs. Accompany
him through his long and painful march
to the coast; behold him, when the powers of
nature are almost exhausted by fatigue and
affliction, urged forward like a brute by the
lash, or, with still more bitterness of suffering,
seeing the fainting powers of his wretched
<span class='pageno' id='Page_342'>342</span>wife or daughter roused into fresh exertions
by the same savage discipline.<a id='r56' /><a href='#f56' class='c011'><sup>[56]</sup></a> Behold him
next brought on shipboard and delivered over
to men, whose colour, appearance, language,
are all strange to him, while every object
around must excite terror. If his wretched
family have not been brought away with him,
he is tormented by the consciousness that they
are left destitute and unprotected, and that his
eyes will see them no more. If his wife and
daughter have been carried off with him, he
sees them dragged away to another part of
the ship, while he is debarred from their
society, and often even from the sight of
them; what must be his anguish, from being
conscious not only that they are suffering
many of the same evils as himself, but still
more, from knowing that they are exposed to
all those brutalities, the idea of which must
be most cutting to a husband or a father;
while his misery becomes more intense, from
the consciousness that they are close to him,
though he cannot alleviate their misery, or
protect their weakness.</p>

<p class='c010'>See our wretched family or individual arriving
at the destined port, and then call to
mind the abominations of the sale of a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_343'>343</span>negro cargo. See the wretched individual or
family exposed naked like brutes, and the
same methods taken as with their fellow
brutes, to ascertain whether or not their
limbs and members are perfect. See them
forced to jump or dance, to prove their agility;
or, still more affecting, see them afraid, each
lest the other only should be bought by some
particular purchaser, and therefore displaying
their agility, while their hearts are wrung with
anguish, in order to induce the buyer to take
them both. Perhaps the different branches of
the family may be bought by different owners;
they may probably be taken to different
islands, and the poor hope of wearing away
together the wretched remainder of their lives
is disappointed; or, if they are purchased
together, see them taken home to the estate,
and entering upon their course of laborious and
bitter degradation; while, looking forward to
the future, not a single ray of hope breaks in
to cheer the prospect, no hope of any alleviation
of drudgery or degradation for them or
for their children, for ever! Suppose our
wretched Slave at length reduced to the level
of his condition, and, either with his own
family or with a new one, suppose him to have
his hard lot in some little measure mitigated
by a very slight taste of domestic and social
comforts. It might well be thought, that, except
<span class='pageno' id='Page_344'>344</span>for the hardships and sufferings inseparable
from such a state of slavery, where
even the necessaries of life must depend on
an owner’s affluence, in a country where we
know that an immense majority are extremely
embarrassed in their affairs—the bitterness of
death would be now past; but a negro Slave
does not die so easily; again probably, possibly
again and again, he is to be subjected
to the brutalities of a sale, and to the pains
of separation from all that are most dear
to him.<a id='r57' /><a href='#f57' class='c011'><sup>[57]</sup></a> He is taken perhaps to form a new
settlement, and forced to the severe labour of
clearing land, in a pestilential soil and climate,
without any of those little accommodations
which ingenious and industrious poverty
might in a course of years have collected
around him, in his old habitation. This, however,
if a severe is still a short suffering, from
which death soon releases him, and is far
preferable to the sad fate of those, who linger
out the tedious remainder of life, separated
from all who have known them in their better
days, and without any of those kindly props
to lean upon, which the merciful ordainer of
all things has provided, for sustaining the
weakness, and mitigating the sorrows of age.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_345'>345</span>To look around, and to see not a single face
of friendship or relationship, no eye to cheer,
no staff to lean upon; surely the comfortless
close of such a Negro’s comfortless life, though
not of equal intensity of suffering with many
of the evils of the former scenes through
which he has passed, is yet, from the deep
tinge and uniform melancholy of its colouring,
as affecting a state, to the humane mind,
as any whatever in a life abounding in all the
varieties of human wretchedness.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Conclusion.</div>

<p class='c010'>Such from first to last is the condition of
human existence, to which that abhorred
traffic the Slave Trade annually consigns
many thousands of our unoffending fellow
creatures. This is a most astonishing
phenomenon, when we consider the general
character of the people of this country; when
we call to mind the unparalleled benevolence
and liberality which are found among us;
when we take into account, that not a new
species of distress can be pointed out, but that
almost immediately some meeting takes place,
some society is formed, for preventing it. Is
it not utterly astonishing, that Great Britain
should have been the prime agents in carrying
on this trade of blood? Posterity will scarcely
believe it. We, the happiest, render the Africans
the most miserable of mankind!</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_346'>346</span>It is a humiliating and an aweful, but, I
fear, it is an undoubted truth; that it is in part,
at least, because we ourselves overflow with
comforts, that we are so indifferent to the
happiness of this vast portion of our fellow
creatures. It is, in our corrupted nature,
too naturally the effect of prosperity to harden
the heart. Yet I firmly believe, that could
many of our opponents see with their own
eyes but a slight sample of the miseries the
Slave Trade occasions, they would themselves
be eager for its termination. But, alas, Africa
and its miseries are out of sight. Business,
pleasure, engagements, the interests and
feelings of the hour, leave little time for reflection,
and therefore little access to the
feelings. Sympathy here likewise operates
against us. For we are readily led to sympathize
with a great West Indian Proprietor;
but not with a miserable negro Slave. Yet,
let me ask (in this happy country the case cannot
really happen), what should we think of
any man, who, for some even considerable
and clear, much more for any dubious interest,
was to make a single family as miserable
as the Slave Trade renders thousands
of families every year? If he were to
keep them month after month and year after
year in continual alarm, from the apprehension
of some nightly attack; if at length the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_347'>347</span>apprehension were to be realized, the attack
to be made, and the wretched beings, flying
from the flames, were to be seized and carried
off into slavery; if he were thus to tear a
father or mother from their children, or to
seize unawares and hurry away some helpless
children from their parents; What would be
his remorse, if he had even innocently been
the occasion of rendering a before happy
family the scene of lasting sorrow and misery?
What should we think of any man, who
would not be forward to dry the tears of such
a family, and restore them, if possible, to
comfort, or who would not willingly expose
himself to danger, in order to prevent their
suffering such a miserable fate. Let every
one then remember, that, by giving his vote
for the abolition of the Slave Trade, he will
prevent the perpetration of innumerable
crimes, like the worst of those here mentioned,
and the suffering of the bitterest of these miseries.
How few, if one single man could be
found, who would support the Slave Trade,
were it but possible to bring before each individual,
of the whole number of those who
may vote for it’s continuance, his own specific
share of the whole mass of crimes and miseries.
The exact amount, either way, will
one day be known!</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_348'>348</span>Forgive me if I seem still to linger; if I
appear unwilling to conclude. When I call
to mind the number and the magnitude of the
interests which are at stake, I know not how
to desist, while any fresh argument remains to
be used, while any consideration not as yet
suggested occurs to me, by which I may enforce
my intercession in behalf of the most
injured of the human race. But though the
mind be naturally led to the Africans, as the
greatest sufferers, yet, unless the Scripture be
a forgery, it is not their cause only that I am
pleading, but the cause of my Country. Yet
let me not here be misconceived. It is not
that I expect any visible and supernatural
effects of the Divine vengeance; though, not
to listen with seriousness to the accounts
which have been brought us of late years
from the western hemisphere, as to a probable
intimation of the Divine displeasure,
would be to resolve to shut our ears against
the warning voice of Providence. To mention
no other particulars, a disease new in it’s
kind, and almost without example destructive
in its ravages, has been for some time raging
in those very colonies which are the chief
supporters of the traffic in human beings; a
disease concerning which we scarcely know
any thing, but that it does not affect the Negro
race, and that we first heard of it after the horrors
<span class='pageno' id='Page_349'>349</span>of the Slave Trade had been completely
developed in the House of Commons, but developed
in vain.</p>

<p class='c010'>But it is often rather in the way of a gradual
decline, than of violent and sudden
shocks, that national crimes are punished. I
must frankly therefore confess to you, that in
the case of my Country’s prosperity or decline,
my hopes and fears are not the sport of
every passing rumour; nor do they rise or
fall materially, according to the successive
reports we may receive of the defeats or
victories of Bonaparte. This consideration
opens the view into a wide field, and I must
abstain from so much as setting my foot on it.
I will only remark, that a country circumstanced
in all respects like this, under an
auspicious Providence, and using our various
resources with energy and wisdom, has no
cause whatever for despondency. But he
who has looked with any care into the page
of history, will acknowledge, that when
nations are prepared for their fall, human
instruments will not be wanting to effect it;
and, left man, vain man, so apt to overrate
the powers and achievements of human
agents, should ascribe the subjugation of the
Romans to the consummate policy and
powers of a Julius Cæsar, their slavery shall
<span class='pageno' id='Page_350'>350</span>be completed by the unwarlike Augustus, and
shall remain entire under the hateful tyranny
of Tiberius, and throughout all the varieties
of their successive masters. Thus it is, that,
most commonly by the operation of natural
causes, and in the way of natural consequences,
Providence governs the world.  But
if we are not blind to the course of human
events, as well as utterly deaf to the plain
instructions of Revelation, we must believe
that a continued course of wickedness, oppression,
and cruelty, obstinately maintained
in spite of the fullest knowledge and the loudest
warnings, must infallibly bring down upon
us the heaviest judgments of the Almighty.
We may ascribe our fall to weak councils, or
unskilful generals; to a factious and over-burthened
people; to storms which waste our
fleets, to diseases which thin our armies; to
mutiny among our soldiers and sailors, which
may even turn against us our own force; to
the diminution of our revenues and the excessive
increase of our debt: men may complain
on one side of a venal ministry, on the
other of a factious opposition; while amid
mutual recriminations, the nation is gradually
verging to it’s fate. Providence will easily
provide means for the accomplishment of it’s
own purposes. It cannot be denied, that there
are circumstances in the situation of this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_351'>351</span>Country, which, reasoning from experience,
we must call marks of a declining empire;
but we have, as I firmly believe, the means
within ourselves of arresting the progress of
this decline. We have been eminently blessed;
we have been long spared; Let us not presume
too far on the forbearance of the
Almighty.</p>

<p class='c010'>Though the king has a great number of wives, yet
but one has the title of queen; who is she that bears
him the first son. Her authority over the rest,
whom she treats rather as her servants, than as her
companions, is so great, that she sometimes sells
them for slaves, without consulting the king, who is
forced to wink at the matter. An affair of this kind
happened while the Sieur d’ Elbée traded here. The
queen, having been refused by the king some goods
or jewels she had an inclination for, ordered them
up privately, and in exchange sent eight of his wives
to the factory, who were immediately stamped with
the Company’s mark, and sent on board.</p>

<p class='c010'>These poor princesses had sunk under so severe a

<p class='c019'>He, said he, was sure it was not the intention of the
duke (the Duke of York) that christians should be
bought and sold as slaves; nor that such as he (meaning
the captain) should be allowed not only to trade,
but to rob and infest the shores wherever they came,
in the same manner as another English captain had
done there the year before; who, as soon as he had
taken in all his lading, fell to wasting the country, and
forced away many of the natives into slavery, and
killed many others whom he could not get away.—(p.
174.)</p>

<p class='c019'>Coto Coast.—Their trade is that of slaves, of
which they are able sometimes to deliver a good
number, but never enough to load a ship. These
they chiefly steal from the inland country. But this
commerce is uncertain; in some years there are no
slaves to be had, the Europeans having no settlement
here. (p. 2.)—Their most profitable trade is stealing
men inland, whom they sell to the Europeans.—(p. 3.)</p>

<p class='c010'>The same author says, that the people of little
Popo depend chiefly on plunder, and the slave trade,
in both which they exceed those of Coto; for,
being endowed with a much larger share of courage,
they rob more successfully; although to freight a
ship with slaves, requires some months attendance.
In 1697, the author could get only three slaves here
in three days time, but they promised him two hundred
in three days more; which not caring to trust to
he sailed to Whidah. There he learnt that they had
succeeded so well in their incursions, as to bring
<span class='pageno' id='Page_355'>355</span>down above two hundred; which, for want of other
ships, they were obliged to sell to the Portuguese.—(p.
4.)</p>

<p class='c010'>Philips informs us that the Whidah blacks are
constantly at war with the Ardrah and Allampo men,
the Quamboors and Achims. All the plunder is
men and women, to sell for slaves.—(p. 53.)</p>

<h5 class='c018'><em>Sieur Brüe’s (many years Director General of the French Senegal Company, and who resided in Africa eleven years) Voyage to the Isles of Bissas and Bissagos, on the Western Coast of Africa, in 1701;—from Astley’s Voyages, Vol. ii.</em></h5>

<p class='c019'>The Sieur Brüe having received an assortment of
goods by a fleet from France, sent notice to the Damel,
or king of Kayor, between the rivers Senegal
and Gambia, as he had promised, and wrote him
word, that if he had a sufficient number of slaves,
he was ready to trade with him.—This prince,
as well as the other negro monarchs, have always
a sure way of supplying this deficiency, by selling
their own subjects; for which they seldom want pretensions,
of some kind or other, to justify their
rapine. The Damel had recourse to this method:
knowing the Sieur Brüe would give him no credit,
as he was already in the Company’s debt, he
seized three hundred of his own people, and sent
word to the Sieur Brüe, that he had slaves to deliver
for his goods, if he would come to Rufisco,
where he waited to receive him.—(p. 29, 30.).</p>

<p class='c010'>The Damel wishing for more goods than his
slaves would purchase, the Sieur Brüe proposed
having a licence to take so many of his people; he
refused to consent, saying, it might occasion a
disturbance amongst his subjects; and so he was
forced to want the goods he desired for that time.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_356'>356</span>The chief sometimes penetrated far into the
country, always returning well loaded with slaves
and spoil.—(42.).</p>

<p class='c010'>This is the negro manner of making war—it is a
great chance if they come to a pitched battle.
Their campaigns are usually mutual incursions, to
plunder and carry off slaves, which they sell to the
traders on the coast.—(p. 42.)</p>

<p class='c010'>The isle of Bassao is very populous, and would
be much more so, if it were not for the frequent
incursions made by the Biafaras, Balantes, and
Bissagos negroes, who often infest the coasts.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Europeans are far from desiring to act as
peace-makers among them, which would be contrary
to their interest; since the greater the wars
are, the more slaves. These wars of theirs are
never long; generally speaking, they are incursions,
or expeditions, of five or six days.—(p. 98.)</p>

<p class='c010'>He then describes the mode of their warfare:
When the emperor of Bassao judges proper to invade
his enemies, he sounds his bonbalon, and immediately
the officers of his troops repair with their
soldiers, armed, to the place directed; there they
find the king’s canoe of war, of which he has a fleet
of twenty-nine or thirty. They put twenty men in
each canoe:—they embark them, full of hope, and
order matters so as to reach the enemy’s country
by night. They land without noise; and if they
find any lone cottage without defence, they surround
it; and after forcing it, carry off all the inhabitants
and effects to their boats, and immediately reimbark.</p>

<p class='c010'>If the villages be strong, they are not fond of
attacking them, but rather plant themselves in ambuscade
on the ways to some river or spring, and
endeavour to surprise and carry off the natives.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_357'>357</span>On the least advantages of this kind gained, they
return in as great a triumph as if they had obtained
a complete victory. The king has, for his duties
and the use of his fleet, the half of the booty. The
rest is divided among the captors. All these slaves
in general are sold to the Europeans, unless they
be persons of some rank, whose friends can redeem
them, paying two slaves, or, five or six oxen.—(p.
98).</p>

<p class='c010'>Of the Bissagoes he says: They are passionate
lovers of brandy. Whenever a ship brings any,
they strive who shall be the first, and stick at nothing
to get it. The weaker becomes a prey to the
stronger. They forget the laws of nature; the father
sells his children; and, if they can seize their parents,
they serve them in the same manner. Every
thing goes for brandy.”—(p. 104.)</p>

<h5 class='c018'><em>Barbot’s Travels, about 1700.—Astley, vol. ii.</em></h5>

<p class='c019'>Barbot, speaking of the blacks, says, rather than
work they will rob and murder on the highway, or
carry off those of a neighbouring village, and sell
them for slaves.—(p. 255.)</p>

<p class='c010'>They go farther yet; for some sell their own children,
kindred, or neighbours. This, Barbot tells us,
has often happened. To compass it, they desire the
person they intend to sell, to help them in carrying
something to the factory, by the way of trade; and
when there the person so deluded, not understanding
the language, is sold and delivered up as a slave,
notwithstanding all his resistance and exclaiming
against the treachery.</p>

<p class='c010'>Le Maire tells an odd story on this occasion,
which Barbot says he heard in Africa. A man, it
seems, had formed a design of selling his son, who,
suspecting his intention, when they came to the
factory, went aside to the storehouse and sold his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_358'>358</span>father. When the old man saw them about to fetter
him he cried out, he was his father; but the son
denying it, the bargain held good. The son met
his desert, for, returning with his merchandize, he
met a negro chief, who stripped him of his ill-gotten
wealth, and sold him at the same market.</p>

<p class='c010'>Abundance of little blacks, of both sexes, are also
stolen away by their neighbours, when found abroad
on the roads, or in the woods, or else in the lugaus,
or corn-fields, where they are kept all day, to scare
the small birds that come in swarms to feed on the
millet.—(p. 256.)</p>

<h5 class='c018'><em>Labat.—Astley’s Voyages. vol ii. p. 259.</em></h5>

<p class='c019'>The French have been forced sometimes to make
use of violent means, when they cannot get the princes
to discharge these forced loans, by pillaging
some village, and making slaves of the inhabitants;
after which they have balanced accounts with his
majesty, and paid for as many as they had taken
above their due. But these measures, says the author,
don’t always succeed; and even though one
was sure of getting paid this way, yet that it would
be better not to make a practice of it, for fear of
drawing the resentment of the country upon a man,
which, sooner or later he would feel to his cost—(p.
258.)</p>

<h5 class='c018'><em>Le Maire’s Travels, about 1690.—Astley’s Voyages, vol. ii.</em></h5>

<p class='c019'>Sometimes the king of Senegal makes incursions
on the weakest of his neighbours, driving off their
cattle, or making slaves of them, which he sells for
brandy. When his stock of this grows low, he locks
it up in a small chest, giving the key to one of his
favorites, whom he dispatches, perhaps thirty leagues
<span class='pageno' id='Page_359'>359</span>off, and thus saves his liquor by putting it out of
his power to get at it. If he has no opportunity of
exercising his tyranny on his neighbours, he makes
no scruple of living on his own subjects, staying with
his court, which consists of two hundred of those
who have learnt all the worst qualities of the
whites, till he has eat up the inhabitants; and, if
they presume to complain, selling them for slaves.—(p.
260.)</p>

<p class='c010'>As long as the brandy bottle lasts the prince is
drunk: no answer is to be expected till all the liquor
is out. When he grows sober, he gives his audience
of <i><span lang="fro" xml:lang="fro">congée</span></i>, presenting the factor with two or three
slaves, which he sends to have taken up in the
nearest villages. Unhappy are they who at that
time fall into the hands of his guards, for they stay
to make no choice.—(p. 260, 261.)</p>

<h5 class='c018'><em>Travels (about 1730), of Francis Moore, Factor several years to the Royal African Company of England.</em></h5>

<p class='c019'>The king of Barsalle, so soon as he has wasted
what he has gotten, either by taking an enemy’s town,
<em>or one of his own</em>, he must look out for some new
prize to give it to his men.—Astley, ii. 261.</p>

<p class='c010'>Rohone, where the king of Barsali commonly resides,
stands near the sea, about one hundred miles
from Joar, which lies in the same kingdom. When
he wants goods or brandy, he sends a messenger to
the governor of James Fort, to desire he would send
up a sloop with a cargo, which the governor never
fails to do. Against the time the vessel is arrived,
the king plunders some of his enemy’s towns, selling
the people for such goods as he wants, which commonly
is brandy or rum, gunpowder, ball, fire-arms,
pistols, and cutlasses for his soldiers, and coral and
silver for his wives and mistresses. If he is at war
<span class='pageno' id='Page_360'>360</span>with no neighbouring king, he falls upon one of his
own towns, and makes bold to sell his own miserable
subjects.</p>

<p class='c010'>His usual way of living is, to sleep all day till
sun-set, at which time he gets up to drink, and goes
to sleep again till midnight, when he rises and eats;
and if he has any strong liquors, will sit and drink
till day-light, and then eat and go to sleep again,
When he is well stocked with liquor, he will sit and
drink for five or six days together, and not eat one
morsel of any thing in all that time. It is to this
insatiable thirst after brandy, that his subjects
freedoms and families are in so precarious a situation<a id='r58' /><a href='#f58' class='c011'><sup>[58]</sup></a>;
for he often goes with some of his troops, by
a town in the daytime, and returns in the night,
and sets fire to three parts of it, placing guards at
the fourth, to seize the people as they run out from
the fire: he ties their arms behind them, and marches
them either to Joar or Rohone, where he sells
them.—(p. 261, 262.). The king furnishes the
Europeans with slaves very easily: he sends a troop
of guards to some village, which they surround;
then seizing as many as they have orders for, they
bind them up and send them away to the ships,
where, the ship mark being put upon them, they are
heard of no more.</p>

<p class='c010'>They usually carry the infants in sacks, and gag
the men and women, for fear they should alarm the
villages through which they are carried; for these
actions are never committed in the villages near the
factories, which it is the king’s interest not to ruin,
but in those up the country. It often happens,
that some escape, and alarm the country, which,
taking arms, join the persons injured, and pursue the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_361'>361</span>robbers. If they catch them, they carry them before
the king, who then denies his commission, and
sells them on the spot for slaves. What is further
remarkable, if any of the injured people appear as
evidence still in bonds before the king, they are also
adjudged to be slaves, and sold as such.<a id='r59' /><a href='#f59' class='c011'><sup>[59]</sup></a>—(p. 268.).</p>

Elizabeth, Captain Creighton, before mentioned,
who invited Capt. Livingstone to take a Christmas
dinner with him, and shewed him a letter from one
Benjamin Cross (third mate of the Expedition, Capt.
Mettisse) who had been <em>panyarred</em> by the natives of
Cape Monte, three months before, and detained there
by way of reprisal for some of their men carried off
by an English trader. This villanous custom is too
often practised, chiefly by the Bristol and Liverpool
ships, and is a great detriment to the Slave Trade
on the Windward coast.<a id='r60' /><a href='#f60' class='c011'><sup>[60]</sup></a>—(p. 475, 476.)</p>

<p class='c010'>Mons. Brüe, (vol. iv.) relating a dispute he had with
the Damel, respecting his giving in English ship liberty
to trade in his dominions, on which M. Brüe seized
and confiscated the vessel, says, “Most of the Negroes
on board, he found, were free fishermen of the
coast, whom the king had decoyed to Potadâlly, under
the pretence of employing their canoes to transport
<span class='pageno' id='Page_362'>362</span>his troops to attack Goree; but as soon as by
this pretence he had assembled them, he sent them
on board, and sold them as Slaves. There was not
the smallest appearance that the Damel had even
conceived so extravagant a project, says M. Brüe,
but it was necessary to form some scheme to entrap
these men, and sell them.” Although the injustice of
the king in trepanning and selling them was notorious,
it mattered not; they were all sent to America, and
sold as Slaves.—(p. 204.)</p>

<p class='c010'>Labat mentions that a Captain of a French man
of war, at the suggestion of a French trader, (the
Captain’s name was Montorsies, and the ship’s, Lion,
and Fond was the name of the trader) pillaged the
Isle of Cazegat, one of the Bissagos Islands. They
landed 200 men without the smallest resistance.
The king, of the island, named Duquermaney, was
surrounded in his houses, and he chose to burn himself
rather than fall into the European hands; the
natives fled to the woods and mountains, so that, of
about 3,000 inhabitants, they took only about a
dozen. This unfortunate enterprise, says our author,
made M. Fond greatly fear, lest he should
lose all trade with these people: but he managed the
matter so cleverly, “<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">il se donna tant de mouvemens,
et fit jouer tant de ressorts</span></i>,” says Labat, that he
made them believe he had no hand at all in the affair,
and assured them it was a parcel of ruffians, a
set of pirates and banditti, who had made this incursion,
by which their king was lost, and their
country laid waste.</p>

<h5 class='c018'><em>Depredations—Effect of Slave Trade.</em></h5>

<p class='c019'>In old Calabar River are two towns, Old Town
and New Town. A rivalship in trade produced a
jealousy between the towns; so that, through fear of
each other, for a considerable time no canoe would
<span class='pageno' id='Page_363'>363</span>leave their towns to go up the river for slaves. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Astley’s Voyages.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> In 1767, seven ships lay off the point which separates the towns; six of the captains invited the people of both towns on board on a certain day, as if to reconcile them; at the same time agreed with the people of New Town to cut off the Old Town people who should remain on board the next morning. The Old Town people, persuaded of the sincerity of the
captains’ proposal, went on board in great numbers.
Next morning, at eight o’clock, one of the ships
fired a gun, as the signal for commencing hostilities.
Some of the traders were secured on board, some
were killed in resisting, and some got overboard and
were fired upon. When the firing began, the New
Town people, who were in ambush behind the Point,
came forward and picked up the people of Old
Town, who were swimming, and had escaped the
firing. After the firing was over, the captains of
five of the ships delivered their prisoners (persons of
consequence) to the New Town canoes; two of
whom were beheaded alongside the ships; the inferior
prisoners were carried to the West Indies.
One of the captains, who had secured three of the
king’s brothers, delivered one of them to the chief
man of New Town, who was one of the two beheaded
alongside; the other brothers he kept on board, promising,
when the ship was slaved, to deliver them to
the chief man of New Town. This ship was soon
slaved, from this promise, and the number of prisoners
made that day; but he refused to deliver the
king’s two brothers, and carried them to the West
Indies, and sold them.</p>

they cannot hear even a harsh expression, or a
raised tone of voice, without shewing that they feel

that it resembles the Elysian fields.</p>

<p class='c010'>There is also a weekly market in the province of
Aplogua, which is so resorted to, that there are
usually five or six thousand merchants.—(p. 11.)</p>

<p class='c009'>Ogilby.—Kingdom of Loango.—There are many
handicrafts among them, as weavers, smiths, cap-makers,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_368'>368</span>bead-makers, potters, carpenters, vintners,
fishermen, canoe-makers, besides merchants and
other traders, (p. 221.)</p>

<p class='c010'>There are whole mountains of porphyry, jasper,
and marble, of divers colours, which in Rome are
called marbles of Numidia, Africa, and Ethiopia;
certain pillars whereof may be seen in the palace of
Pope Gregory. (p. 299.)</p>

<h5 class='c018'><em>Natural Qualities and Disposition of Africans.</em></h5>

<p class='c019'>Capt. Wilson, of the Royal Navy (in Africa about
1783–4) fully believes Africans to be equal to Europeans
in capacity. They have various manufactures,
chiefly for home consumption. They make cotton
cloths beautifully fine, under every want of machinery:
also very curious ornaments of gold, and
weapons and tools of iron, which their experience
makes them prefer to those sent from hence, which
are made for them.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Africans are most grateful and affectionate:
they treated him most kindly, when many miles up
their country, and unprotected; and numbers shed
tears on his departure.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mr. Wadstrom (in Africa, about 1787–8.) thinks
the Africans very honest and hospitable; was
treated by them with all civility and kindness. Is
clearly convinced that the Negroes surpass such
Europeans as he has known, in affection. Has been
surprised at their industry in manufacturing cotton,
indigo, iron, soap, wood, pottery, leather, and
other articles. They work gold so well, that witness
never saw better wrought trinkets and ornaments
in Europe. They manufacture cloth and
leather with uncommon neatness. The latter they
tan and work into saddles, sandals, and a variety
of useful and ornamental articles. They forge iron
<span class='pageno' id='Page_369'>369</span>very dexterously on anvils of a remarkably hard
and heavy wood, when they cannot get stone for the
purpose.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Negroes are particularly skilful in manufacturing
iron and gold. They are equal to any
European goldsmith in fillagree, and even other
articles, as buckles, except the chafes, tongues, and
anchors.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Rev. John Newton:—Made five voyages to
Africa, the last in 1754, as master of a slave ship. Lived
ashore about a year and a half, chiefly at the island
of Plantanes, at the mouth of the river Sherbro.</p>

<p class='c010'>Always judged, that, with equal advantage, the
natives capacities would be equal to ours. Has
known many of real and decided capacity.</p>

<p class='c010'>The best people he met with were on the R.
Gaboon, and at C. Lopas. These had then the
least intercourse with Europe. Believes they had
then no Slave Trade, and has heard them speak
against it. They traded in ivory and wax. One
great man said, “if I was to be angry, and sell my
boy, how should I get my boy back when my
anger was gone?”</p>

<p class='c010'>They are generally worse in their conduct in
proportion to their acquaintance with us.</p>

<p class='c009'>Capt. Sir George Young, Royal Navy; in Africa
from 1768 to 1792.—Many Negroes he met with
seemed to possess as strong natural sense as any
set of people whatever; their temper appeared to
be very good-natured and civil, unless where they
suspected some injury; are, however, naturally vindictive,
and revenge the injury done.</p>

<p class='c009'>Henry Hew Dalrymple, Esq.; in Africa 1779.—As
far as he could judge, in natural capacity, the
Negroes are equal to any people whatever; and in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_370'>370</span>temper and disposition they appeared to be humane,
hospitable, and well disposed.</p>

<p class='c009'>James Towne; about 1760, Carpenter of his
Majesty’s ship Syren.—The natives are hospitable
and kind, and capable of learning quicker than white
men. They differ as our own people in character;
those on the coast learn to be roguish; inland, they
are innocent. The intercourse with Europeans has
improved them in roguery, to plunder and steal,
and pick up one another to sell.</p>

<h5 class='c018'><em>African Commercial Tendencies.</em></h5>

<p class='c019'>Mr. Wadstrom.—The Africans have an extraordinary
genius for commerce and industry. The
Slave Trade makes it dangerous for the Negroes to
pass from one part of their country to another, and
is the chief hindrance to the improvement of their
cultivation, since they never venture into the fields,
unless very well armed.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Negroes are particularly skilful in manufacturing
iron and gold; they are equal to any European
goldsmith in fillagree, and even other articles, as
buckles, except the chapes, tongues, and anchors.</p>

<p class='c009'>Captain Sir George Young, Royal Navy.—He
verily believes that the natives would cultivate the
soil for natural productions, provided they had no
other means of obtaining European commodities.
He recollects some circumstances in proof of their
industry. A number of people from the Bulam
shore came over to Sierra Leone, and offered their
services to work at a very low price; he accepted of
a few (who worked very well) and might have had
thousands of the same description. Further is of
opinion, from observation, that Africa is capable of
producing every thing of the East and West Indies,
in equal perfection, with equal cultivation.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_371'>371</span>Is of opinion, that, by shewing the natives of
Africa how to cultivate the land, a greater quantity
of shipping and seamen would be called for in the
commerce, for the natural productions of that country,
without any greater inconvenience, in point of
health to the seamen, than in the present West Indian
trade.</p>

<p class='c009'>Anthony Pantaleo How, Esq.; in Africa about
1785.—Saw no European commodities in the interior
parts; is sure no European spirits were to be
had there. The inhabitants there remarkably industrious,
also hospitable and obliging. A village of
several hundred houses on the Lake of Appolonia,
whence in the rainy season they supply the sea coast
with vegetables, grain, palm wine, &amp;c. Thinks they
have but little capacity in regard to manufactures,
but quick in learning languages.</p>

<p class='c010'>Has no doubt but spices in general, and all other
tropical productions, might be cultivated with success
there. The soil and climate adapted to produce the
sandal wood. Has seen indigo at Apollonia in its
raw state, and also manufactured, but not manufacturing;
also cotton growing in great abundance; but
knows not that any or either of these two articles
were exported.</p>

<p class='c010'>Cinnamon plants at St. Thomas, at the sea-side,
about twenty feet high; from what he heard, grew
inland to a higher size; those on the sea-side he considered
only as shrubs. He saw a number of them,
and, from the appearance of the bark brought down,
concludes there must be a great quantity inland.</p>

<p class='c009'>Henry Hew Dalrymple, Esq.; in Africa about
1779.—They manufacture cotton cloths, almost
equal in the workmanship to those of Europe; they
work in gold, silver, and iron remarkably neat, also
in wood, and make saddles, bow-cases, scabbards,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_372'>372</span><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Golberey.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
grisgris, and other things of leather, with great neatness.</p>

<p class='c009'>Richard Storey; in Africa, about 1766 to 1770.—He
looks upon the natives of the Windward coast to
be in general a hospitable, friendly people, always
willing to sell what they have, and also to give the
best provisions the country affords. The men in
general are very active and industrious, and chiefly
employed in fishing, and trade with the Europeans;
the women chiefly in cultivating rice and other vegetables.</p>

<p class='c010'>Has every reason to believe, that if there was nobody
to purchase Slaves, they would turn themselves
to cultivate their ground, and raise rice, &amp;c. to purchase
European goods. The quality of African
rice is far superior to that of Carolina, bearing one-fourth
more water.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mr. James Kiernan; in Africa from 1775 to 1780;
knows the Negroes manufacture cotton, leather, and
metals, for they supply Senegal with cloathing, articles
of leather, and ornaments of gold and silver;
they die some of their cottons very finely, blues and
scarlets; believes their consumption of cotton cloths
is very considerable.</p>

<h5 class='c018'><em>Africans’ Natural Dispositions—Golberey’s Travels, about 1786.</em></h5>

<p class='c019'>The Foulhas of the banks of the Senegal are intelligent
and industrious; but, by their habitual commerce
with the Moors of Zahara, they have become
savage and cruel, and our convoys from Galam
have more than once experienced their perfidy.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Mandings are likewise dispersed over the
western countries; they are well-informed, graceful,
and active, and in their mercantile character, they
are as clever as they are indefatigable.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_373'>373</span>The Jalofs are the finest Negroes of this part of
Africa; they are tall, and well made; their features
are regular, their physiognomy is open, and inspires
confidence; they are honest, hospitable, generous,
and faithful; their character is mild, they are inclined
to good order and civilization, and possess
an evident disposition for benevolent actions.</p>

<p class='c010'>Vol. ii. page 40. At Senegal I was treated with
a cordiality, frankness, and generosity, which will
never be obliterated from my memory.</p>

<p class='c010'>Page 93. Their character is in general, honest
and sincere; hospitality is a natural virtue among
them.</p>

<p class='c010'>Page 141. Ali Sonko had governed the kingdom
of Barra for seven years, with all the ability, wisdom,
and prudence, of an enlightened European;
his physiognomy was regular and agreeable, and
there was seen in him that wisdom and experience
which generally distinguish the Manding nation.
His estimable character was replete with benevolence
and energy; all his actions were regulated by
wisdom, and every trait in this prince announced
him to be a man of a superior kind.</p>

<p class='c010'>Page 146. Mandings are very active, intelligent,
and cunning, in commercial affairs; notwithstanding
which, their general character is very hospitable,
sociable, and benevolent; their women are also very
lively, spirited, good, and agreeable.</p>

<p class='c010'>Page 306. The Negroes have both taste and
ingenuity.</p>

<p class='c010'>Page 309. The women are always kind; attentive,
and complaisant.</p>

<p class='c010'>Page 313. The Negro race is perhaps the most
prolific of all the human species that exist on our
globe. Their infancy and youth are singularly
happy; the mothers are passionately fond of their
children.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_374'>374</span>Page 314. It ought to be understood, that in
the general situation of the Negroes, on their native
soil, their life passes without labour, chagrin, or
even care.</p>

<p class='c010'>Page 315. The passing almost the whole of the
human life in a nearly equal and permanent state of
health, is owing to the moderation the Negroes in
general observe in their habits, regimen, and pleasures.</p>

<p class='c010'>Page 326. These Negroes, whom we call Savages,
respect the ashes of their relations, friends, and
chiefs.</p>

<p class='c010'>Page 336. It cannot be denied that the Negroes
are extremely clever.</p>

<p class='c010'>Page 346. Among the Negroes are to be found
virtuous and sensible men, who, as well as those of
the best education and information in Europe, are
susceptible of attachment, respect, delicate conduct,
and a noble generosity.</p>

<p class='c010'>Page 348. These examples of delicacy and friendship
are not by any means rare in Africa.</p>

<p class='c010'>Page 382. Hospitality is in Africa a general
virtue, and misers are unknown in the country.</p>

<p class='c010'>Page 412. All that I have said of the Negroes
tends to prove that they are in general good men,
naturally gentle and benevolent.</p>

<p class='c010'>Page 413. The Moors are perfidious, cruel,
capable of all crimes, and are addicted to every
vice; but the Negroes have many naturally good
qualities, and their general character does honour to
human nature.</p>

<p class='c010'>The picture I have given of the situation of the
Blacks, and of the peaceable, careless, and simple
life of these favourites of Nature, is by no means
exaggerated.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_375'>375</span>
  <h5 class='c018'><em>State of Slaves on Shipboard.</em></h5>
</div>

<p class='c019'>They often disagree in the night about their sleeping-places;
the men linked together often fight,
when one wants perhaps to obey the calls of nature,
and the other is unwilling to go with him.</p>

<p class='c010'>They often refused to eat, especially beans, when
they were corrected with a cat-o’-nine-tails. He has
known their refusal to eat attributed to sullenness,
when owing to sickness; particularly one man, who
was corrected moderately for not eating, and was
found dead next morning. They were made after
meals to jump, on beating a drum; this is called
dancing; when they refused, they were compelled
by the cat.</p>

<p class='c010'>It is very common for the Slaves to refuse sustenance;
with such, gentle means are used; but if without
success; the cat is generally applied.</p>

<p class='c010'>An instance on board induced him to believe they
were as affectionate as most other people. Bouny,
one of the higher class, was brought on board; he
seemed to take his situation to heart, and got ill, but,
from indulgencies which none of the rest had, he
partly recovered. When he was convalescent, a
young woman was also brought on board, who
proved to be his sister. At their first meeting, they
stood in silence, and looked at each other, apparently
with the greatest affection; they rushed into each
others arms, embraced, separated themselves again,
and again embraced: the witness perceived the tears
to run down the female’s cheeks.</p>

<p class='c010'>They are made to jump in their irons; this is
called dancing by Slave dealers. While a surgeon in
a Slave ship, has been often desired, in every ship, to
flog such as would not jump: he had generally a cat
in his hand among the women.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Parke.</div>

<p class='c010'>Jillifree is much resorted to by Europeans, on
account of the great quantities of bees wax
which are brought hither for sale: the wax is collected
in the woods by the Feloops, a wild and
unsociable race of people; their country, which is
of considerable extent, abounds in rice; and the
natives supply the traders, both on the Gambia
and Cassamansa rivers, with that article, and also
with goats and poultry, on very reasonable terms.—(P.
4.)</p>

<p class='c010'>The usual beast of burthen in all the Negro territories
is the ass.—(p. 12.)</p>

<p class='c010'>Their fierce and unrelenting disposition is, however,
counterbalanced by many good qualities; they
display the utmost gratitude and affection towards
their benefactors; and the fidelity with which they
preserve whatever is entrusted to them is remarkable.
During the present war they have more
than once taken up arms to defend our merchant
vessels from French privateers; and English property,
of considerable value, has frequently been
left at Vintain, for a long time, entirely under the
care of the Feloops, who have uniformly manifested
on such occasions the strictest honesty and punctuality.—(p.
16.)</p>

<p class='c010'>The government in all the Mandingo States,
near the Gambia, is monarchical. The power of
the sovereign is, however, by no means unlimited.
In all affairs of importance; the king calls an assembly
of the principal men, or elders, by whose
councils he is directed.—(p. 19.)</p>

<p class='c010'>In every considerable town there is a chief magistrate,
called the Alcaid, whose office is hereditary,
and whose business it is to preserve order,
to levy duties on travellers, and to preside at all
<span class='pageno' id='Page_377'>377</span>conferences in the exercise of local jurisdiction
and the administration of justice. These courts are
composed of the elders of the town (of free condition)
and are termed Palavers; and their proceedings
are conducted in the open air, with sufficient
solemnity. Both sides of a question are freely canvassed,
witnesses are publicly examined, and the
decisions which follow generally meet with the approbation
of the surrounding audience, (p. 19.)</p>

<p class='c010'>Professional advocates, or expounders of the law,
who are allowed to appear, and to plead for plaintiff
or defendant, much in the same manner as in the
law courts of Great Britain.—(p. 20.)</p>

<p class='c010'>The Mandingoes, generally speaking, are of a
mild, sociable, and obliging disposition.—(p. 21.)</p>

<p class='c010'>The Negroes do not go to supper till late, and, in
order to amuse themselves while our beef was preparing,
a Mandingo was desired to relate some diverting
stories; in listening to which, and smoking
tobacco, we spent three hours. These stories bear
some resemblance to those in the Arabian Night’s
Entertainments; but, in general, are of a more
ludicrous cast—(p. 31.)</p>

<p class='c010'>It is worthy of remark, that an African will sooner
forgive a blow, than a term of reproach applied to
his ancestors: “Strike me, but do not curse my
mother!” is a common expression among the
Slaves.—(p. 47.)</p>

<p class='c010'>We were amused by an itinerant singing-man,
who told a number of diverting stories, and played
some sweet airs. These are a sort of travelling
bards and musicians, who sing extempore songs in
praise of those who employ them.—(p. 48.)</p>

<p class='c010'>The industry of the Foulahs, in the occupations of
pasturage and agriculture, is every where remarkable.—(p.
61.)</p>

<p class='c010'>In Bondou they are opulent in a high degree, and
enjoy all the necessaries of life in the greatest profusion.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_378'>378</span>They display great skill in the management
of their cattle, making them extremely gentle by
kindness and familiarity.—(p. 61.)</p>

<p class='c010'>“At two o’clock we came in sight of Jumbo, the
Blacksmith’s native town, from whence he had been
absent more than four years. Soon after this his
brother, who had by some means been apprized of
his coming, came out to meet him, accompanied
by a singing-man; he brought a horse for the Blacksmith,
that he might enter his native town in a dignified
manner; and he desired each of us to put a
good charge of powder into our guns. The singing-man
now led the way, followed by the two brothers;
and we were presently joined by a number of people
from the town, all of whom demonstrated great
joy at seeing their old acquaintance the Blacksmith,
by the most extravagant jumping and singing. On
entering the town the singing man began an extempore
song in praise of the Blacksmith, extolling his
courage in having overcome so many difficulties,
and concluding with a strict injunction to his friends
to dress him plenty of victuals.—(p. 81.)</p>

<p class='c010'>“When we arrived at the Blacksmith’s place of
residence, we dismounted, and fired our muskets.
The meeting between him and his relations was
very tender; for these rude children of nature, free
from restraint, display their emotions in the strongest
and most expressive manner. Amid these transports,
the Blacksmith’s aged mother was led forth leaning
upon a staff. <em>Every one made way for her</em>; and she
stretched forth her hand to bid her son welcome.
Being totally blind, she stroked his hands, arms, and
face, with great care, and seemed highly delighted
that her latter days were blessed by his return, and
that her ears once more heard the music of his voice.
From this interview, I was fully convinced, that
whatever difference there is between the Negro and
European, in the conformation of the nose, and the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_379'>379</span>colour of the skin, there is none in the genuine sympathies
and characteristic feelings of our common
nature.”—(p. 81.)</p>

<p class='c010'>“With these worthy people I spent the remainder
of that and the whole of the ensuing day in feasting
and merriment.”—(p. 83.)</p>

<p class='c010'>“I had a most enchanting prospect of the country.
The number of towns and villages, and the extensive
cultivation around them, surpassed every thing
I had ever seen in Africa.”—(p. 88.)</p>

<p class='c010'>“Feb. 4th. We departed from Loomoo, and
continued our route along the banks of the Krieks,
which are every where well cultivated, and swarm
with inhabitants.”—(p. 89.)</p>

<p class='c010'>“I lodged at the house of a Negro who practised
the art of making gunpowder. He shewed me a bag
of nitre, very white, but the crystals were much
smaller than common, They procure it in considerable
quantities from the ponds, which are filled in
the rainy season.”—(p. 116.)</p>

<p class='c010'>“The Moors supply them with sulphur from the
Mediterranean; and the process is completed by
pounding the different articles together in a wooden
mortar.—(p. 117.)</p>

<p class='c010'>“Their sabres, as well as their fire-arms and
ammunition, they purchase from the Europeans, in
exchange for the Negro Slaves, which they obtain
in their predatory excursions.”—(p. 150.)</p>

<p class='c010'>“Cultivation is carried on here on a very extensive
scale; and, as the natives themselves express it,
hunger is never known.”—(p. 187.)</p>

<p class='c010'>“From the best inquiries I could make, I have
reason to believe that Lego contains altogether about
thirty thousand inhabitants.”—“The view of this
extensive city, the numerous canoes upon the river,
the crowded population, and the cultivated state of
the surrounding country, formed altogether a prospect
of civilization and magnificence, which I little
<span class='pageno' id='Page_380'>380</span>expected to find in the bosom of Africa.”—(p. 195
&amp; 196.)</p>

<p class='c010'>“I was regarded with astonishment and fear,
and was obliged to sit all day without victuals, in
the shade of a tree, and the night threatened to be
very uncomfortable, for the wind rose, and there was
great appearance of a heavy rain; and the wild
beasts are so very numerous in the neighbourhood,
that I should have been under the necessity of
climbing up the tree, and resting among the branches.
About sun-set, however, as I was preparing to pass
the night in this manner, and had turned my horse
loose that he might graze at liberty, a woman, returning
from the labours of the field, stopped to
observe me, and perceiving that I was weary and
dejected, inquired into my situation, which I briefly
explained to her; whereupon, with looks of great
compassion, she took up my saddle and bridle, and
told me to follow her. Having conducted me into
her hut, she lighted up a lamp, spread a mat on
the floor, and told me I might remain there for the
night. Finding that I was very hungry, she said she
would procure me something to eat; she accordingly
went out, and returned in a short time with a
very fine fish, which, having caused to be half broiled
upon some embers, she gave me for supper. The
rites of hospitality being thus performed towards a
stranger in distress, my worthy benefactress (pointing
to the mat, and telling me I might sleep
there without apprehension), called to the female
part of her family, who had stood gazing on me all
the while in fixed astonishment, to resume their
task of spinning cotton; in which they continued to
employ themselves great part of the night. They
lightened their labour by songs, one of which was
composed extempore, for I was myself the subject
of it; it was sung by one of the young women,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_381'>381</span>the rest joining in a sort of chorus. The air was
sweet and plaintive, and the words, literally translated,
were these:—“The winds roared, and the
rains fell—The poor white man, faint and weary,
came and sat under our tree—He has no mother
to bring him milk, no wife to grind his corn.”
Chorus: “Let us pity the white man; no mother
has he,” &amp;c. &amp;c.—Trifling as this recital may appear
to the reader, to a person in my situation the circumstance
was affecting in the highest degree. I
was oppressed by such unexpected kindness, and
sleep fell from my eyes. In the morning I presented
my compassionate landlady with two of the
four brass buttons which remained on my waistcoat,
the only recompence I could make her.”

<p class='c010'>“About eight o’clock we passed a large town called
Kabba, situated in the midst of a beautiful and
highly cultivated country, bearing a greater resemblance
to the centre of England, than to what I

Africa.”—(p. 202).</p>

<p class='c010'>“We passed, in the course of the day, a great
many villages, inhabited chiefly by fishermen; and
in the evening, about five o’clock, arrived at Sansanding,
a very large town, containing, as I was
told, from eight to ten thousand inhabitants.”—(p.

<p class='c010'>“We accordingly rode along between the town

him. This conduct so enraged the king, that when
he returned from Maniana, about the beginning of
the rainy season, and found the dooty protected by
the inhabitants, he sat down before Sai, with his
army, and surrounded the town with the trenches I
had now seen. After a siege of two months, the
towns-people became involved in all the horrors of
famine; and whilst the king’s army were feasting in
their trenches, they saw with pleasure the miserable
inhabitants of Sai devour the leaves and bark of the
bentang tree that stood in the middle of the town.
Finding, however, that the besieged would sooner
perish than surrender, the king had recourse to treachery.
He promised, that if they would open the
gates, no person should be put to death, nor suffer
any injury, but the dooty alone. The poor old man
determined to sacrifice himself for the sake of his
fellow-citizens, and immediately walked over to the
king’s army, where he was put to death. His son,
in attempting to escape, was caught and massacred
in the trenches; and the rest of the towns-people were
carried away captives, and sold as Slaves to the different
Negro Traders.”—(p. 227.)</p>

<p class='c010'>“The Mandingoes in particular are a very gentle
race; cheerful in their dispositions, inquisitive, credulous,
simple, and fond of flattery.”—(p. 261.)</p>

<p class='c010'>“It is impossible for me to forget the disinterested
charity, and tender solicitude, with which many of
these poor heathens (from the sovereign of Sego, to
the poor women who received me at different times
into their cottages, when I was perishing of hunger)
sympathized with me in my sufferings, relieved my
distresses, and contributed to my safety.”—(p.
262.)</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_383'>383</span>“Accordingly, the maternal affection (neither
suppressed by the restraints, nor diverted by the
solicitudes of civilized life) is every where conspicuous
among them, and creates a correspondent return
of tenderness in the child. An illustration of
this has been given in p. 47, “Strike me,” said
my attendant, “but do not curse my mother!” The
same sentiment I found universally to prevail; and
observed in all parts of Africa, that the greatest
affront which could be offered to a Negro, was to
reflect on her who gave him birth.”—(p. 264.)</p>

<p class='c010'>“One of the first lessons, in which the Mandingo
women instruct their children, is the <em>practice
of truth</em>. The reader will probably recollect the
case of the unhappy mother, whose son was murdered
by the Moorish banditti at Funingkedy, page
102. Her only consolation in her uttermost distress,
was the reflection, that the poor boy, in the
course of his blameless life, had <em>never told a lie</em>.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“For, though the Negro women are very cheerful
and frank in their behaviour, they are by no
means given to intrigue: I believe that instances of
conjugal infidelity are not common.”—(p. 268.)</p>

<p class='c010'>“With the love of music is naturally connected
a taste for poetry; and, fortunately for the poets of
Africa, they are in a great measure exempted from
that neglect and indigence, which, in more polished
countries, commonly attend the votaries of the
Muses. They consist of two classes; the most numerous
are the singing-men, called jilli kea, mentioned
in a former part of my narrative. One or
more of these may be found in every town. They
sing extempore songs in honour of their chief men,
or any other persons who are willing to give “solid
pudding for empty praise.” But a nobler part of
their office is to recite the historical events of their
country; hence, in war, they accompany the soldiers
to the field, in order, by reciting the great actions of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_384'>384</span>their ancestors, to awaken in them a spirit of glorious
emulation. The other class are devotees of the Mahometan
faith, who travel about the country singing
devout hymns, and performing religious ceremonies,
to conciliate the favour of the Almighty, either in
averting calamity, or insuring success to any enterprise.
Both descriptions of these itinerant bards are
much employed, and respected by the people, and
very liberal contributions are made for them.”—(p.
278.)</p>

<p class='c010'>“The Negroes in general, and the Mandingoes
in particular, are considered by the whites on the
coast as an indolent and inactive people; I think,
without reason. Few people work harder, when
occasion requires, than the Mandingoes; but, not
having many opportunities of turning to advantage
the superfluous produce of their labour, they are
content with cultivating as much ground only as is
necessary for their own support.—(pp. 280, 281.)</p>

<p class='c010'>“The labours of the field give them pretty full employment
during the rains; and in the dry season,
the people who live in the vicinity of large rivers
employ themselves chiefly in fishing.” “Others of
the natives employ themselves in hunting.” “They
are very dextrous marksmen, and will hit a lizard on
a tree, or any other small object, at an amazing distance.”
“While the men are employed in these
pursuits, the women are very diligent in manufacturing
cotton cloth.” “The thread is not fine, but
well twisted, and makes a very durable cloth. A
woman, with common diligence, will spin from six
to nine garments of this cloth in one year.” “The
loom is made exactly upon the same principle as that
of Europe, but so small and narrow, that the web is
seldom more than four inches broad.” “The women
dye this cloth of a rich and lasting blue colour,
with a fine purple gloss, and equal, in my opinion,
to the best Indian or European blue. This cloth is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_385'>385</span>cut into various pieces, and sewed into garments
with needles of the natives own making.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“As the arts of weaving, dying, sewing &amp;c. may
easily be acquired, those who exercise them are not
considered in Africa as following any particular profession;
for almost every Slave can weave, and every
boy can sew. The only artists which are distinctly
acknowledged as such by the Negroes, and who
value themselves on exercising appropriate and peculiar
trades, are the manufacturers of leather and
iron.” “They are to be found in almost every
town.” “They tan and dress leather with very
great expedition.” “They are at great pains to
render the hide as soft and pliant as possible.” “The
hides of bullocks are converted chiefly into sandals,
and therefore require less care in dressing than the
skins of sheep and goats, which are used for covering
quivers and saphies, and in making sheaths for
swords and knives, belts, pockets, and a variety of
ornaments.”—(pp. 281, 282.)</p>

<p class='c010'>“The manufacturers of iron are not so numerous
as of leather; but they appear to have studied
their business with equal diligence.” “In the inland
parts, the natives smelt this useful metal in
such quantities, as not only to supply themselves
from it with all necessary weapons and instruments,
but even to make it an article of commerce with
some of the neighbouring states.”—(p. 283.)</p>

<p class='c010'>“Most of the African blacksmiths are acquainted
also with the method of smelting gold.” “They
likewise draw the gold into wire, and form it into a
variety of ornaments, some of which are executed
with a great deal of taste and ingenuity.” “I
might add, though it is scarce worthy observation,
that in Bambarra and Kaarta, the natives make very
beautiful baskets, hats, and other articles, both for
use and ornament, from rushes, which they stain of
different colours; and they contrive also to cover
<span class='pageno' id='Page_386'>386</span>their calabashes with interwoven cane, dyed in the
same manner,”—(p. 285.)</p>

<p class='c010'>“It seems to be the universal wish of mankind
to spend the evening of their days where they spent
their infancy. The poor Negro feels this desire in
its full force. To him, no water is sweet but what
is drawn from his own well; and no tree has so
cool and pleasant a shade as the tabba tree of his
native village. When war compels him to abandon
the delightful spot in which he first drew his
breath, and seek for safety in some other kingdom,
his time is spent in talking about the country of his
ancestors; and no sooner is peace restored than he
turns his back upon the land of strangers, rebuilds
with haste his fallen walls, and exults to see the
smoke ascend from his native village.”—(p. 292.)</p>

<p class='c010'>“It was not possible for me to behold the wonderful
fertility of the soil, the vast herds of cattle,
proper both for labour and food, and a variety of
other circumstances favourable to colonization and
agriculture; and reflect withal, on the means which
presented themselves of a vast inland navigation,
without lamenting that a country, so abundantly
gifted and favoured by nature, should remain in its
present savage and neglected state. Much more
did I lament that a people, of manners and dispositions
so gentle and benevolent, should either be left
as they now are, immersed in the gross and uncomfortable
blindness of Pagan superstition, or permitted
to become converts to a system of bigotry and
fanaticism.”—(p. 312.)</p>

<p class='c010'>“During a wearisome peregrination of more
than five hundred British miles, exposed to the burning
rays of a tropical sun, these poor Slaves, amidst
their own infinitely greater sufferings, would commiserate
mine; and frequently, of their own accord,
bring water to quench my thirst, and at night collect
<span class='pageno' id='Page_387'>387</span>branches and leaves to prepare me a bed in the
wilderness.”—(p. 356.)</p>

<p class='c010'>“Crimes here are seldom punished with death,
unless it be treason and murder. For other faults,
the usual penalty is banishment, to which end the
king generally sells them to the company, and disposes
of their effects at his pleasure. In civil cases,
the debtor, if unable, is sold with his family and
effects, for the payment of the creditor, and the king
has his thirds.”—(p. 59.)</p>

<p class='c009'>Barbot says, that the Negro kings are so absolute,
that upon any slight pretence, they order their
subjects to be sold for Slaves, without regard to rank
or profession. Thus a Marbut was sold to him at
Goree by the Alkade of Rio Fresco, by special
order of the Damel, for some misdemeanors. This
priest was above two months aboard the ship before
he would speak one word.”—(<cite>Travels of Barbot</cite>,
p. 257.)</p>

<p class='c010'>“The smallest crimes whatever are punished
with banishment.—(p. 315.)</p>

<p class='c009'>Criminal causes are tried by a public Palaver, or
Assembly of the head men of the country, and Slavery
is the usual punishment; a circumstance which
holds out a strong temptation to prefer false accusations,
particularly as the African mode of trial
furnishes convenient means of promoting purposes
of avarice and oppression.—(<cite>Winterbottom’s Account</cite>,
&amp;c. &amp;c.)</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_388'>388</span>Marchais.—In case of the debtor’s insolvency,
the king allows the creditor to sell him, his wives,
and even his children, for the sum due. Here is also
another extraordinary law; if the creditor, before
witnesses, three times asks his debt of a person,
whom he cannot arrest or sue on account of his
dignity or power, and the debtor refuses to pay him,
the creditor has a right to seize the first Slave he
meets, let him belong to whom he will.</p>

<p class='c010'>There is but one sort of punishment for offences
here, the offender, and all his generation, being made
Slaves.</p>

<p class='c010'>In their proceedings they take no care whether
the party be guilty, or deserves to be punished.</p>

<div  class='c016'></div>
<div class='sidenote'>Golberey.</div>

<p class='c010'>It is a striking circumstance, that in Africa, before
the Slave Trade was introduced, the punishments
for offences generally consisted of mulcts or
fines, as is evident from the testimony of Artus,
Barbot, Ogilby, Bosman, Loyer, Nyendael, and
others, and that nobody was mulcted beyond his
ability, except by an accumulation of crimes. Murder
and sorcery were punished capitally in some of
the countries of Africa, but in others, murder and
every species of offence had no other punishment
than a fine. If people could not pay these fines,
they were disposed of in two ways. Some of them
were sent into a temporary banishment in Africa;
others were sold into home slavery. Debtors also,
who refused to pay their debts, or became insolvent,
were sold for the benefit of their creditors, in case
their relations would not redeem them, and worked
for these at their respective homes. But since
this trade has been used, says Moore, all <em>punishments</em>
are changed into <em>slavery</em>: there being <em>an advantage</em>
in such condemnation, they <em>strain</em> for crimes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_389'>389</span><em>very hard</em>, in order to get the <em>benefit of selling the
criminal</em>. Not only murder, theft, and adultery,
are punished by selling the criminal for a Slave,
but <em>every trifling</em> crime is punished in the same
manner.”<a id='r61' /><a href='#f61' class='c011'><sup>[61]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>Moore gives us a history of some of these crimes.
“There was a man, says he, brought to me in
Tommany, to be sold, for having stolen a tobacco-pipe.
I sent for the alcade, and with much ado
persuaded the party aggrieved to accept of a composition,
and leave the man free. In Cantore, a
man seeing a tyger eating a deer, which he had
killed and hung up near his house, fired at the tyger,
and the bullet killed a man. The king not only
condemned him, but also <em>his mother</em>, <em>three brothers</em>,
and <em>three sisters</em>, to be sold. These eight persons were
brought down to me at Yamyamacunda. It made
my heart ache, says Moore (<em>for this was in the infancy
of the Trade</em>) to see them, and I did not buy
them.” But it appears in the sequel, that this kind
action in Moore did not produce the desired end.
“For they were sent, says he, further down the
river, and sold to some <em>separate</em> traders at Joar,
and the king <em>had the benefit of the goods</em> for which
they were sold.”</p>

<p class='c010'>In estimating the revenues of king Forbana, he
mentions<a id='r62' /><a href='#f62' class='c011'><sup>[62]</sup></a> “the criminals that were sold, <em>a part of
the profit</em> of <em>which</em> devolved <em>upon his majesty</em>.”
<a id='r63' /><a href='#f63' class='c011'><sup>[63]</sup></a>
“In Africa, says he, crimes are punished
either by fines, slavery, or death. <em>Offences</em> are
<em>rare</em>, but <em>accusations common</em>; because the chiefs
frequently accuse for the purpose of <em>condemning</em>, that
<em>they may be able to procure Slaves</em>.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_390'>390</span>“The crime of magic is that which the Negro
kings and chiefs most frequently <em>cause</em> to be preferred
against individuals of the lower class, <em>because
this crime is punished by slavery, and consequently
produces Slaves</em>.”</p>

Capt. Wilson, of the Royal Navy, says, it is
universally acknowledged, and he believes it to be
true, that free persons are sold for real or imputed
crimes, for the benefit of their judges. Soon after
his arrival at Goree, the king of Damel sent a free
man to him for sale, and was to have the <em>price himself</em>.
One of the king’s guards, who came with the
man, on being asked whether he was guilty of the
crime imputed to him, replied, with great shrewdness—he
did not conceive that was ever inquired
into, or of any consequence.</p>

<p class='c009'><a id='r65' /><a href='#f65' class='c011'><sup>[65]</sup></a>
Dr. Trotter says, that of the whole cargo, he recollects
only three criminals in the ship where he
was. One of these had been sold for adultery, and
the other for <em>witchcraft, whose whole family shared
his fate</em>. The first said, he had been decoyed by a
woman, who told her husband of the transaction,
and he was sentenced to pay a Slave; but, being
poor, he was sold himself. Such <em>stratagems</em> are
<em>frequent</em>. The fourth mate of the ship Brookes was
so decoyed, and obliged to pay a Slave, under the
threat, that trade would be stopped if he did not.
The other had quarrelled with one of the Cabosheers.
The Cabosher, in revenge, accused him of
witchcraft. In consequence of this accusation he
was sold with his family. His mother, wife, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_391'>391</span>two daughters, were sentenced with him. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>House of Commons Evidence.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> The women shewed the deepest affliction; the man a sullen melancholy; he refused his food, tore his throat open with his nails, and died.</p>

Lieutenant Simpson, of the Royal Marines, considered
two crimes as almost made on purpose to
procure Slaves. These were, adultery, and the removal
of <em>Fetiches</em>, (or of <em>charms founded on a notion
of witchcraft</em>). As to adultery, he was warned
against connecting himself with any woman not
pointed out to him, for that the kings <em>kept several</em>,
who were <em>sent out to allure the unwary</em>; and that, if
found to be connected with these, he would be
seized, and made to pay the price of a man Slave.
As to fetiches, consisting of pieces of wood,
old pitchers, kettles, &amp;c. laid in the path-ways,
he was <em>warned to avoid displacing</em> them, for if he
should, the natives, who were on the watch, would
seize him, and, as before, exact the price of a man
Slave. These baits were laid equally for the natives,
as the Europeans; but the former were better
acquainted with the law, and consequently more circumspect.</p>

<p class='c009'>James Morley, 1760 and 1776.—On pretence of
adultery, he remembers a woman sold. He learnt
that this was only a pretence, from her own mouth,

with which her husband, king Ephraim, treated her,
when he came on board; whereas, in real cases of
adultery, they are very desperate.</p>

they had become so hardened, that neither the love
of God, nor that of the king (William the Conqueror)
had been able to abolish it. For they sold
into Ireland, at a profit, people whom they had
bought up throughout all England, and they exposed
to sale maidens in a state of pregnancy, with whom
they made a sort of mock marriages. There you

elegant forms and in the very bloom of youth, a
sight sufficient to excite pity even in Barbarians,
daily offered for sale to the first purchaser. Accursed
deed! infamous disgrace! that men, acting
in a manner which brutal instinct alone would have
forbidden, should sell into slavery their relations,
nay, even their own offspring; yet, St. Wolstan
destroyed at length this inveterate and hereditary
custom. The historian goes on to state, that from
the effect of religious instruction, the people of
Bristol not only renounced this vicious practice
<span class='pageno' id='Page_396'>396</span>themselves, but afforded an example of reform to
the rest of England; harsh methods however were
resorted to where persuasion was in vain; for one
of the inhabitants of Bristol who resisted the good
bishop’s reform with peculiar obstinacy, was expelled
from the city, and had his eyes put out.</p>

<p class='c010'>In 1171, on the invasion and conquest of Ireland
by Henry II. it was the unanimous judgment of a
great ecclesiastical council, called at Armagh, that
the event was to be regarded as a providential visitation
for their guilt in making Slaves of the English,
whether obtained from merchants, robbers, or
pirates; and this opinion was regarded as the more
probable, because England herself, the natives of
which, by a vice common to that nation, had been
used to sell their children and nearest relatives, even
when not under the pressure of famine or other
necessity, had formerly expiated a similar crime
by a similar punishment (alluding to the Norman
Conquest.) To the honour of the Irish, a resolution
was then passed, that throughout the kingdom the
English Slaves should be immediately emancipated.
I trust their Hibernian descendants, in our day,
will shew themselves actuated by a like humane
spirit, and that the English will no longer continue
subject to that foul stain with which, even in these
early days, she was contaminated.</p>

<p class='c010'>The city of Bristol is once more exempt from
the disgrace of being concerned in the traffic of
human beings.</p>

every trifling crime is punished by selling the criminal
for a Slave.’</p>

<p class='c010'><a href='#r9'>9</a>. Surely Mr. Parke, when he suggested this, forgot
that experience as well as reason teach us, that we must
first abolish the Slave Trade before we attempt to diffuse
among the Africans the lessons of peace and love; lest
we are asked the same well-known question, and receive
the same reply, as the Spanish priest from the poor dying
Peruvian, when the Spaniards in America were acting
on the plan which is here advised, of at once ravaging
and converting: “Are there to be any Europeans in this
Heaven, where you wish me to secure a place?”
Being told yes, “Then it is no place for Peruvians.”</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f10'>
<p class='c010'><a href='#r10'>10</a>. This is the more astonishing, because it is mentioned
by the older writers as well as by more recent
travellers, as Captain Sir G. Young and Sir T. B. Thompson,
as a term of which the meaning is clear, and the
use perfectly familiar. Thus, as a single instance, Smith,
after saying “the natives were afraid of being panyard,”
(p. 104.) subjoins the meaning in a note,—“To panyar
is to kidnap or steal men. It is a word used all over

very severely during their passage to New South Wales,
and if I mistake not, for I speak from memory, several
of them at length died from the hardships which they
endured. On inquiring into the cause, it was stated to
be, that the person whose province it was to provide
necessaries for the voyage, had, by mistake, purchased
such fetters as were used on board Slave ships, instead
of the common fetters for convicts.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f22'>
<p class='c010'><a href='#r22'>22</a>. The professional Planter’s own words well deserve
to be inserted: “For I aver it boldly, melancholy experience
having given me occasion to make the remark,
that a great number of Negroes have perished
annually by diseases produced by inanition. To be
convinced of this truth, let us trace the effect of that
system, which assigned, for a Negro’s weekly allowance,
six or seven pints of flour, or grain, with as
many salt herrings; and it is in vain to conceal what
we all know to be true, that in many of the islands
they did not give more. With so scanty a pittance,
It is indeed possible for the soul and body to be held
together a considerable portion of time, provided a
man’s only business be to live, and his spirits be husbanded
with a frugal hand; but if motion short of labour,
much more labour itself, and that too intense,
be exacted from him, how is the body to support itself.”—“Their
attempts to wield the hoe prove abortive,
they shrink from their toil, and, being urged to
perseverance by stripes, you are soon obliged to receive
them into the hospital, whence, unless your
plan be speedily corrected, they depart but to the
grave. It may possibly be urged in palliation of this
practice, that in cases of such short allowance as I
have mentioned above, Negroes do not depend upon
that solely for their subsistence, but that they derive
considerable aid from little vacant spots on the estate,
which they are allowed to cultivate on their own account. Though frequently otherwise, this may sometimes
be the case; yet even there it is to be observed,
that such spots, in the low-land plantations, are capable
of producing only for a part of the year, either
through the drought of the season or the sterility of
the soil, and when that happens, the Negro is again
at his short allowance; and having no honest means
of eking it out, to make it square with the demands
of nature, he is compelled to pilfer.”—The writer
goes on to state, that the delinquent, extending his
thefts, is detected and apprehended, is severely whipped
and chained, and confined; but as neither chains nor
stripes, nor confinement, can extinguish hunger, he
returns, when released, to the same practices, till, partly
from the discipline, partly from scanty nourishment, and
colds from exposure during his desertion, he, ten to one,
falls into a distempered habit, which soon hurries him
out of the world. The close is very remarkable, “Now
this was set down as a vicious incorrigible subject,
and his death is deemed a beneficial release to the
estate.”</p>

perished in consequence of the law for recovery
of debts, which permits Negroes to be levied on and
sold at vendue. By this means they are frequently
torn from their native spot, their dearest connections,

health, labouring under discontent, which co-operates
with change of place and circumstance to shorten

</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f30'>
<p class='c010'><a href='#r30'>30</a>. But a nearer, and more particular view of the
manner of working may be necessary to those who
have never seen a gang of Negroes at their work:</p>

<p class='c010'>“When employed in the labour of the field, as for
example, in <em>holeing a cane piece</em>, i. e. in turning up the
ground with hoes into parallel trenches, for the reception
of the cane plants, the Slaves of both sexes, from
twenty perhaps to four score in number, are drawn out
in a line, like troops on a parade, each with a hoe in
his hand; and close to them in the rear is stationed a
driver, or several drivers, in numbers duly proportioned
to that of the gang. Each of these drivers, who are
always the most active and vigorous Negroes on the
estate, has in his hand, or coiled round his neck, from
which by extending the handle it can be disengaged
in a moment, a long, thick, and strongly platted whip,
called a <em>cart-whip</em>, the report of which is as loud, and
the lash as severe, as those of the whips in common
use with our waggoners, and which he has authority
to apply, at the instant when his eye perceives an
occasion, without any previous warning. Thus disposed,
their work begins, and continues without interruption
for a certain number of hours, during which, at
the peril of the drivers, an adequate portion of land
must be holed.</p>

<p class='c010'>“As the trenches (continues our Author) are generally
rectilinear, and the whole line of holers advance together,
it is necessary that every hole or section of the
trench should be finished in equal time with the rest;
and if any one or more Negroes were allowed to throw
in the hoe with less rapidity or energy than their companions
in other parts of the line, it is obvious that the
work of the latter must be suspended; or else, such
part of the trench as is passed over by the former, will
be more imperfectly formed than the rest. It is therefore
the business of the drivers not only to urge forward
the whole gang with sufficient speed, but
sedulously to watch that all in the line, whether male
or female, old or young, strong or feeble, work as
nearly as possible in equal time, and with equal effect.
The tardy stroke must be quickened, and the languid
invigorated, and the whole line made to <em>dress</em>, in the
military phrase, as it advances. No breathing time,
no resting on the hoe, no pause of languor, to be repaid
by brisker exertion on return to work, can be
allowed to individuals: all artist work, or pause together.”</p>

<p class='c010'><a href='#r34'>34</a>. The very words which I am now writing suggest to
my mind another possible explanation of the conduct of
the Assembly of Barbadoes. Possibly the majority,
in rejecting the Governor’s proposition, acted not so
much from their own judgment and feelings, as from
deference to those of the bulk of the community. Considering
that, as is stated above, it must be regarded as a
part of their duty to set the tone of public judgment and
feelings, this would not be a very creditable plea; nor
have I found any hint of it in the papers laid before the
House of Commons; but, on the contrary, an expression
of resentment against the Governor, with an intimation
of the danger of interfering between Master and Slave.
But as the idea in question has occurred to me, I think I
should scarcely be acting candidly in suppressing it.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f36'>
<p class='c010'><a href='#r36'>36</a>. The passage to which I allude, contains such important
truths, and bears so strongly on the point now under
discussion, that I shall take the liberty of inserting a
large part of it. I should place it in the Appendix, but
that, for various reasons, I wish not to introduce in the
Appendix any article respecting the West Indian branch
of the subject.</p>

<p class='c010'>“To superior morality I lay no claim; but I understood
my interest, and happily, interest and morality
were not in that case, as in many others, at variance.
I lost very few Negroes in comparison with other gentlemen,
even of such as were purchased out of Guinea
yards, and surprisingly few of the infants born on the
estate.</p>

<p class='c010'>“It may be urged, as an objection to this system
of management, that the expence attending it would
be too great to be defrayed with such a portion of the
produce of the estate as it is consistent with prudence
to apply to that object alone. That the expences of
estates will be considerably larger than at present I admit,
because it is proposed that the Negroes should be
fed and clothed more liberally than they now are, and
be more indulged during their indisposition; whence
an excess of expence, and an apparent decrease of income:
But let it be remembered at the same time,
that an expenditure, when judiciously applied, is not
a waste, but the investment of a capital with a view
to productive return. It will be found so in this case;
for, when Negroes are so treated, there will be fewer
sick than in the common mode of management, and
they will certainly be enabled to make much more
vigorous efforts when engaged at their labour; for
they will be more robust of body, more alert and contented
in mind, so that, performing more work, the
gross income of the estate, far from being reduced,
will necessarily experience a considerable increase.
But not only the gross income will be greater, but it
may be presumed that fewer Negroes will die, and
that more will be born, so as to afford a reasonable
hope that your number may be kept entire without
any foreign recruits; whence a saving in itself, probably
equivalent to the extraordinaries incurred by the
proposed melioration of their treatment; and the balance
at the end of the year, so far from being against
the planter, will probably be in his favour. Were it,
however, otherwise, who would not submit to a small
pecuniary loss, for the inappreciable advantage resulting
from a mind contented with itself, and conscious
of no neglect of duty? As to those who are unfortunately
in such a situation, with respect to incumbrance
and credit, as to be disabled from supplying their Negroes
as they ought, it behoves them to consider whether
by the utmost their undue savings can effect, they can
possibly be retrieved from their embarrassments, and
if they can, they ought seriously to ponder on the
consequence by which their relief is to be obtained;
that it must be by the blood of their own species—a
horrid thought; and if they cannot, how much better
would it be for them to surrender at once their property
to their creditors, and to repose in the humble,
though exquisite enjoyment of ease of mind, and a
fair name, and to trust to recommendations for a
future subsistence, which, in the West Indies, is never
denied to the industrious, while it is frequently conferred
on the undeserving.”</p>

proved both in the Sierra Leone and Bulam
Colonies. Vide Sierra Leone Company’s Report; and

<p class='c010'><a href='#r48'>48</a>. These expectations have been just now confirmed

the President of the United States, Congress are passing
an act for abolishing the Slave Trade on January 1st
1808.</p>

<p class='c010'><a href='#r52'>52</a>. Nothing can shew more clearly the degree of this
security, than that the Jamaica newspapers have been
allowed to print, not only the detailed account of all our
parliamentary debates about the abolition of the Slave
Trade, but even the particulars of the St. Domingo
transactions.—Surely the West Indian Petitioners to the
House of Lords were ignorant of these facts, or rather
perhaps they thought the Abolitionists were ignorant of
them, when the mere discussion of the question here was
stated to be so alarming.</p>

<p class='c010'><a href='#r54'>54</a>. The petition of the Assembly of Jamaica, in 1775,
plainly recognizes the source of danger here alluded to.
“Weak and feeble (says the Assembly) as this colony
is, from its very small number of white inhabitants,
and its peculiar situation, from the incumbrance of
more than 200,000 Slaves,” &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f55'>
<p class='c010'><a href='#r55'>55</a>. For the illustration of this part of the subject, and of
many other topics which I have slightly touched, I must
refer my readers to Mr. Brougham’s Colonial Policy; a
work from some parts of which I must express my
decided dissent, but which contains a most valuable fund
of commercial and financial, political and moral facts,
and suggestions on all the various subjects connected
with colonial interests and affairs.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
